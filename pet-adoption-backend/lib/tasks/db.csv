Joseph Cox,Dog,Afador,https://cdn2-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2019/08/afador-mixed-dog-breed-pictures-cover.jpg,Female,5,Available,"Afadors are mixed breed dogs. They are not purebreds like their Afghan Hound or Labrador Retriever parents.The most common Afador colors include black, brown, gray, red, and fawn.Shedding will definitely occur! Lots of grooming is required to keep the breed's coat in good condition--consider twice weekly brushing to be the minimum.The Afador does much better in colder climates rather than warm ones. Even so, kit your Afador out with a suitable winter coat if temperatures really drop.As an athletic mixed breed, the Afador will love to play fetch and folic in a safe off-leash environment. If you have a fenced-in yard, be warned that this is a dog that can easily leap over a six foot fence, so plan accordingly.Due to the breed's intelligence and stubborn streak, you'll want to make sure that both the dog and your children are properly trained to be around each other from day one."
Patricia Ruiz,Dog,Affenpinscher,https://cdn2-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2011/01/file_23096_affenpinscher-460x290.jpg,Female,2,Available,"The Affenpinscher, also known as the ""Monkey Dog"" (""affen"" means ""ape/monkey"" in German, and ""pinscher"" means ""terrier""), is small but feisty, full of spunk and energy. This mustachioed little devil is descended from the numerous small terriers that populated 17th and 18th century stables and shops throughout Europe, ridding them of rats and mice.Some of the intelligent, wiry-haired dogs must have caught the eye of ladies, because eventually they were bred to be smaller, the better to be a companion dog. Today the Affen is a rare breed, but he came to public notice in 2002 when Ch Yarrow's Super Nova won the Toy Group in 2002 at the nationally televised Westminster Kennel Club Show.This breed combines clownlike charm with a bold nature, and his creative thought process never ceases to astound and entertain his people. He learns quickly and adjusts readily to change, so he's a good traveler who's always ready for a new adventure. People who live with Affens admire their sensitivity and gentleness but warn that they are the quintessential big dog in a small body.Sturdy, smart, and alert, the Affenpinscher is an excellent watchdog who fears nothing. He's not normally loud, but he is excitable. Once he's on alert, it takes a while for him to calm down. He takes seriously his duty to guard home, family, and territory, and won't hesitate to alert the entire neighborhood that someone is approaching the front door. Frequent socialization with other people and animals is a must for the Affenpinscher to grow up to be a balanced adult. Without it, he'll never live up to his potential.The Affenpinscher has a mind of his own and is often labeled as stubborn. He needs early and consistent training. Fortunately, he's eager to learn and to please his people when he's taught with positive reinforcement techniques such as praise, play, and food rewards. He can compete in obedience and agility, and his entertainment ability makes him a wonderful therapy dog. Who wouldn't laugh to see him walking on his hind legs or waggling his eyebrows in a canine impersonation of Groucho Marx?While Affenpinschers are known for making their people laugh, they are not the best breed for a household full of children in spite of their antics. They aren't known to particularly like children, and they won't hesitate to bite if provoked.The Affen is a character, and that's part of his appeal. Consider him if you're interested in a small dog who enjoys seeing the sights, is an excellent watchdog, and will always make you laugh."
Dylan Dunn,Dog,Afghan Hound,https://cdn2-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2011/01/file_23004_afghan-hound-460x290.jpg,Female,9,Available,"The Afghan Hound was originally used for hunting large prey in both the deserts and in the mountains of Afghanistan, where his abundant, flowing coat was needed for warmth. The Afghan was highly valued for his ability to run _яс fast and over great distances _яс courageously holding dangerous animals, such as leopards, at bay until his huntsman on horseback caught up. The Afghan was also valued for his ability to think and hunt independently, without human direction.Today's Afghan Hound isn't hunting leopards but this sighthound does retain the independent nature of a coursing hound. An Afghan puppy will eagerly seek affection from family members, just like puppies of any breed, but this puppyhood behavior can fool unsuspecting owners. Cute puppy antics diminish as the Afghan matures. A mature Afghan Hound does not lavish attention on anyone, and sometimes doen't even want to be hugged or petted. The free-thinking, independent Afghan will decide for himself when he wants affection, and it will be on his terms _яс not yours.Independence and indifference aside, the Afghan Hound is tender when he wishes to be and can be very amusing. Often referred to as a ""clown"" by his affectionate family, the Afghan Hound is known to be mischievous and stories abound of this breed's ability to steal objects from under the very noses of family members, even going so far as to open dresser drawers and snatch clothes.With an ability to see far greater distances than humans and pivotal hip joints that enable him to cover ground quickly and easily clear obstacles, the Afghan is a natural for a sport called lure coursing. In lure coursing, the hounds give chase to plastic bags that are used to create the effect of escaping game. This competition tests the dog's ability to hunt by sight, and basic coursing instinct. In 1972, the American Sighthound Field Association (ASFA) began, and continues to operate and oversee a program much loved by owners and dogs alike.Whether competing in a coursing event, or enjoying life as a playful family companion, the Afghan Hound is a one-of-a-kind breed."
Jennifer Moyer,Dog,Airedale Terrier,https://cdn3-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2011/01/file_23050_airedale-terrier-460x290.jpg,Female,2,Available,"During World War I, a hardy Airedale Terrier named Jack braved the battlefields to deliver a message to British headquarters. Running through a half-mile of swamp, artillery raining down on him, Jack suffered a shattered leg and broken jaw. Sadly, he passed away soon after he'd completed his mission. Incredibly, the message he was carrying saved his battalion and he was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for ""Gallantry in the Field."" The bravery and courage exhibited by Jack holds true for today's Airedales.Dogs like Jack were bred as a multi-purpose dog who had the keenness of a terrier, but could swim and smell prey. Airedale Terriers have the distinction of being both a sporting and working dog, and today compete in agility, obedience, and hunt tests.They enjoy life the most when there is a job to be done, even if it is simply entertaining children, with whom he gets along splendidly. (Nevertheless, an adult should always supervise interactions between kids and dogs.)Like all terriers, the Airedale has a penchant for digging, chasing, and barking. He is full of energy and makes an excellent jogging companion. Daily walks and romps in the yard are among his favorite activities.You can't talk about the Airedale without mentioning his independent streak. This is an intelligent dog who thinks for himself and does not always wait for direction from his owner. If you want a highly biddable dog that awaits your every command, the Airedale Terrier is not the breed for you. However, if you are stimulated by challenge, living with an Airedale may suit you.It's worth mentioning that the Airedale Terrier is unforgiving of any harsh treatment and will hold a grudge against the aggressor. He can be aggressive to other dogs and animals, and has a strong prey drive, which makes him difficult to handle at times. It is said that the Airedale doesn't start fights _яс he finishes them. Consistent, positive obedience training is a must, as is a securely fenced yard.Not surprisingly, the Airedale is an excellent watchdog. He will protect his family from intruders with fierce and brave loyalty. However, he is friendly to invited guests in his home.Make no mistake: The Airedale isn't all business _яс his flipside is comical and playful. He enjoys the company of his family, and he loves romping and playing, tossing toys, stealing dirty socks, grabbing food off the kitchen counter, and just generally creating mischief. He matures slowly, and is often puppyish well into old age.The Airedale is a fascinating breed. He's courageous and athletic, stylish and silly. Many owners say that the only thing better than one Airedale Terrier is two."
Blake Brown,Dog,Akita,https://cdn2-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2011/01/file_22906_akita-460x290.jpg,Male,3,Available,"The Akita is a big, bold dog with a distinctly powerful appearance: a large head in contrast to small, triangular eyes; and a confident, rugged stance. The mere presence of a powerful Akita serves as a deterrent to most who would cause trouble.This breed is renowned for unwavering loyalty to their owners, and they can be surprisingly sweet and affectionate with family members. Imagine a loving protector who will follow you from room to room, whose entire mission in life seems to be simply to serve you.The Akita is courageous, a natural guardian of their family. Stubborn and willful, they won't back down from a challenge. They don't usually bark unless there is a good reason, but they are vocal, making amusing grunts, moans, and mumbles. Some owners say the Akita mutters under their breath and seem to be talking to themselves, while others say the Akita offers their opinion on all matters, from how to load the dishwasher to when the children should be put to bed.While these charming ""talking"" traits are exhibited to family, the Akita is often aloof and silent with visitors. They're naturally wary of strangers, though they will be welcoming enough to a house guest as long as their owners are home.Socializing the Akita puppy (or retraining an adult dog) with as much exposure to friendly people as possible can help soften the edge of their wariness, though an Akita will always be an Akita_ясa dignified and sober presence, not a party animal.One of the Akita's singular traits is mouthing. The Akita loves to carry things around in their mouth, and that includes your wrist. This is not an act of aggression, but simply an Akita way of communicating with those they love. They may lead you to their leash because they want to go for a walk, for example, or act on any number of other ideas that pop into their intelligent head.Many owners are charmed by the Akita's mouthing, but if you find it annoying, simply give your Akita a job that involves carrying something. They would happily get the newspaper or your slippers for you, or retrieve the mail or even those keys you keep misplacing.The Akita also proves themselves unusual with their grooming habits, licking their body like a cat. And that's not their only ""feline"" trait: like a tiger, they'll stalk their prey silently, body low to the ground. This is not a dog that will growl or bark a warning before springing into action.At 100 pounds or more, the Akita is a lot of muscular power. This is a dominating breed, and the Akita will want to dominate you. Proper training is essential, and training should be done by the owner. Because the Akita is so faithfully loyal, the bond between the owner and the dog must not be broken by boarding the dog with a trainer.Before adopting an Akita, it is crucial to spend time researching how to train this particular breed. Akitas do not respond well to harsh training methods. If your training is respectful, the dog will, in turn, respect you.But be prepared for training to take longer than it does for other breeds. Though the Akita is highly intelligent, stubborn willfulness is a part of their personality, which can and does interfere with training. The best results come from doing plenty of homework on how to train before ever bringing an Akita home with you. This is not a breed for the timid.The willful and determined Akita is also, despite their public reserve, a very social pet who needs plenty of time with their family. They not do well as a backyard dog. Companionship holds hands with loyalty, which is what this breed is all about. To make them live outside without benefit of family is to deny the very essence of the Akita breed. A lonely and bored Akita can become destructive and aggressive.The Akita is not recommended for first-time dog owners, for those who want a lapdog, or for those unwilling to take charge. But for owners who can and will invest time and effort in research and proper training, the reward is a fine, intelligent companion with unwavering loyalty.In addition to all other considerations, choosing an Akita means deciding which side of a controversy you want to stand on. This controversy is ""the split,"" and it relates to the Japanese or American standard for the breed.The Japanese Akita is considerably smaller, both in height and mass, than the American Akita_ясas much as 30 or more pounds lighter. Their foxlike head is decidedly different from the broad head of the American breed. The Japanese Akita has almond-shaped eyes, while the American Akita's eyes are triangular. A black mask is much in vogue on the American Akita but is considered a show disqualifier in Japan, where markings on the face are white.If you want your dog to compete in any American Kennel Club events, the black mask means the dog has been bred to the American standard and will be allowed to compete. In fact, in America, any color on the Akita is permitted; in Japan, only red, white, and some brindles are allowed.So wide are the differences between the types that it would seem that a split would be best for the breed. There appear to be as many strongly in favor of the split as there are those who are strongly against it. Deciding which standard to choose should be done only after much research and is largely a matter of personal taste.The Akita's natural hunting skills translate well to various activities. They still hunt today and are able to hold large game at bay until the hunter arrives. They can also retrieve waterfowl. They are adept at tracking, and their catlike movements make them talented in agility. Akita owners are increasingly surprising those skeptics who believe that the Akita nature prevents success in this field. While it's true that the breed's stubbornness can make training a challenge, Akitas and their owners are taking home ribbons as more people discover the thrill of accomplishment in working with this dog."
Brian Arellano,Dog,Alaskan Klee Kai,https://cdn3-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2017/11/alaskan-klee-kai-breed-pictures-cover-460x260.jpg,Male,8,Available,"Unlike the Alaskan and Siberian Huskies they are descended from, Alaskan Klee Kais are meant to be companion dogs, rather than working animals that pull sleds. While they look similar to Huskies, Alaskan Klee Kais have some obvious differences in temperament, including their wariness of strangers. While they don't care for unfamiliar faces, they are very loving family dogs, and their constant vigilance makes them good watchdogs. Alaskan Klee Kais adore attention from their humans and are eager to please, which makes them highly trainable. Though they are a relatively new breed that is not recognized by the American Kennel Club, they are recognized by several other kennel clubs, and many breed standards have been established. That said, there is still variation among dogs within the breed, and some breeders are working to change less desirable temperament traits, such as skittishness. Alaskan Klee Kais are not bred by many, so they still remain a fairly rare breed throughout the world."
Hayley Fitzpatrick,Dog,Alaskan Malamute,https://cdn2-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2011/01/file_22908_alaskan-malamute-460x290.jpg,Female,6,Available,"When you first see an Alaskan Malamute, it's easy to be impressed by their large stature, wolf-like facial markings, and huge plumed tail waving at you. It's often believed that Malamutes are part wolf. They might play a wolf on TV or in the movies, but in truth they're all domestic dog.The Alaskan Malamute possesses tremendous strength, energy, endurance, independence, and intelligence. They were originally sought to pull heavy sleds over long distances as well as to hunt seals and polar bears. Now chosen primarily for companionship, Alaskan Malamutes succeed in several dog sports, including conformation, obedience competition, weight pulling, skijoring, backpacking, and recreational sledding.When they're not ""woo wooing"" or pulling you on your inline skates or watching TV with you, they're probably raiding the trash, surfing your kitchen counters for something good to eat, or digging a nice cool hole in the backyard.Malamutes regard everyone they meet as their friends. If you're looking for a watchdog, this is not the breed for you. A Malamute's size might scare off an intruder, but that's about the only protection you'll get out of them.Alaskan Malamutes do best in situations in which they have plenty of room and opportunities to exercise so they don't become bored and restless. Their independent nature often causes them to be labeled as stubborn or stupid, but their intelligence shines through with the correct training. If the Alaskan Malamute is the right breed for you, they will give you years of enjoyment as an active playmate and companion who keeps their puppy joie de vivre well into adult life."
Patricia Guzman,Dog,American Bulldog,https://cdn3-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2017/12/american-bulldog-breed-pictures-9-460x260.jpg,Female,2,Available,"American Bulldogs are generally happy, family-loving dogs that do well in homes where they have plenty of space to roam.A big, fenced-in backyard is practically a must-have for one of these energetic dogs, though exercise needs may vary by specific type and breeding. They may be just fine with urban life, so long as they get plenty of walks, and they can even make good jogging or running buddies.They do not, however, take very well to being left alone for long periods of time, and they can feel cooped up in an apartment. If their physical and mental stimulation needs aren't met, they can become bored and destructive.American Bulldogs need experienced owners who can be patient with training and start socialization early. So long as they are well trained, they'll get along just fine with children and other pets, though it is still important to supervise them as you would with any dog.Whether they are used for hunting and farm work or just cuddling up with their humans, the American Bulldog makes for an excellent, loyal companion and a competent watchdog."

He eagerly seeks his quarry, singing out as he hunts, a trait that carries over into home life. This hound will bark. On the plus side, he's pleasant toward people and other dogs. If you won't be hunting him, plan to give this swift and competitive dog plenty of daily exercise in other ways to prevent him from becoming frustrated and destructive. He'd make a good companion for a runner."
Evan Martinez,Dog,American Eskimo Dog,https://cdn3-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2011/01/file_23134_american-eskimo-dog-460x290.jpg,Female,8,Available,"Perhaps it's his white fluffy coat. Or jaunty personality. Or intelligence. Whatever ""it"" is, the American Eskimo Dog's got it in spades, and he uses it to captivate his owners.The Eskie is primarily a companion dog, a devoted family member who thrives in the middle of family activities. He is cheerful, affectionate, sometimes rowdy, and very smart _яс so smart he's thought to be one of the most intelligent dog breeds. He's an independent thinker, curious, with an uncanny ability to problem-solve. He excels in activities that require him to use his brain, such as obedience training, tricks, agility, conformation, and other dog sports.Interestingly, Eskies were once favorite circus performers. With his adorable looks and ability to learn quickly, the Eskie traveled about the United States in the late 19th century, stunning audiences with his amazing tricks.With intelligence comes independence, however. The Eskie is a freethinker, and those who know him recommend obedience training starting from puppyhood. Otherwise, this smart dog will outsmart his owner. Training teaches him proper canine manners and respect for his pack leader _яс you.In spite of his diminutive size, the Eskie thinks big. He's an excellent watchdog and will announce the comings and goings of strangers with barking _яс in fact, he can become a problem barker if left alone too long. Although he'll warm up in time to those he doesn't know, his first instinct is to be suspicious. The Eskie takes his watchdog duties very seriously, though he isn't overly aggressive.If you want a breed that has a lot to say, consider the American Eskimo Dog. This breed is very vocal, engaging in barks, yowls, and even mumbles. Many owners claim that their Eskies ""talk"" to them.If the Eskie isn't talking, he might be chewing. Most are avid chewers and need a constant supply of chew toys to keep them from munching ""illegal"" household items (and to help keep their teeth clean and healthy).The friendly Eskie is excellent with other dogs, cats, and children (though no dog of any breed should be left unsupervised with a young child).When it comes to activity, the American Eskimo Dog tends to be busy. He likes to keep moving, especially when young. (Older Eskies often become more sedate, preferring being petted and cuddled to running around.) Many owners keep more than one Eskie so the dogs can keep each other entertained, though lone Eskies do very well in busy households. Eskies make excellent apartment dogs as long as they are walked regularly and given plenty of opportunities for exercise.The American Eskimo Dog makes a beautiful, active companion for a household of one person or for a large family. A well-trained Eskie gives his family years of fun and joy."

Or perhaps you were introduced to the breed through Rita Mae Brown's Mrs. Murphy mystery series, set in Virginia hunt country with a number of American Foxhounds as key characters.This rare breed still lives and works the way its ancestors did when they came to this country more than 200 years ago. Bred to hunt in large packs, American Foxhounds were developed from hounds brought by English settlers, who adapted them to suit the game and terrain of their new land.American Foxhounds like the company of other dogs but can be a single companion dog if you're committed to giving them the exercise they'd normally get running around with their canine friends, and to spending the time to help them bond with their human family. Despite their size, they're mild-mannered unless they're in pursuit of their quarry. Then they become relentless in the hunt.Like all hounds, the Foxhound is musical. Hounds are described as having bell-like voices, and their baying can carry for miles. It's best not to bring one home unless you're sure your neighbors will appreciate the concert or live far enough away that they won't be disturbed."

The main colors of this breed are yellow, black, brindle, red and blue, or mouse color. Any of these may also include white points and a white collar.Their outer coat is rough, and the undercoat is fine and woolly. They're fairly easy to groom.The UKC recognized this breed in 1998 as the Leopard Cur and, along with the breeder association, changed the breed's name to American Leopard Hound in 2008 so that the dogs could compete in events involving coonhounds.The American Leopard Hound is a gentle and easily sociable breed, which makes them great with children of all ages.

In fact, ""pit bull"" isn't a breed, but a term used to describe the American Pit Bull Terrier, the Bull Terrier, the American Staffordshire Terrier, and the Staffordshire Bull Terrier.Some people say the American Pit Bull Terrier is the same as the American Staffordshire Terrier. Others, just as forcefully, say they're entirely different breeds.But all experts can agree that the confusion started with a decision by the AKC in the early 1930s to give it a new name, American Staffordshire Terrier, to separate it from its pit-fighting past. The American Pit Bull Terrier has not been recognized by the AKC, while the American Staffordshire Terrier, which is slightly smaller, has been.The bull breeds are often grossly misunderstood. The qualities that make these dogs tenacious players in obedience and agility games also attract highly unscrupulous people looking for strong competitors for their dog fighting rings. The sorry result is that bull breeds, in particular the APBT, have gained a reputation over recent years for being dangerous.Nothing could be further from the truth. But rampant misinformation and fear caused by the actions of a minority of dogs kept by criminally negligent people have provoked legislation against the breed in a number of cities and countries around the world.As the owner of an American Pit Bull Terrier you must be aware that you may be met with anger and hostility by people who are misinformed about your wonderful dog. This is not a breed for everyone, especially those who aren't willing to invest time in training and socialization and can't or won't provide consistent firm guidance.When raised with the proper training and socialization, the American Pit Bull Terrier makes an excellent companion for children. He is loving and gentle with people and often makes a lousy guard dog because of his tail-wagging eagerness to greet the person at the door. American Pit Bull Terriers are devoted and loyal to their family and will, if necessary, defend them to the death.These dogs are extremely intelligent and learn commands and tricks with ease. They have a zest for life and love to be involved in everything going on around them. They maintain a puppyish demeanor well into adulthood, and that vitality makes them a joy to live with. Once you have met and gotten to know this breed you will wonder how you ever lived without one."

They are generally a blend of two or more colors.This breed is not hypoallergenic, however their short coats do mean they are easy to groom. A good brushing two to three times per week, should suffice.Because they tend to have shorter coats, American Pugabulls aren't particularly suited for extreme weather. You'll likely need a coat in the winter, and you may need to apply dog sunscreen in the summer.So long as they are trained properly, Pugabulls are great with children and are very loyal to all members of the family.American Pugabulls do best with early training. They need a strong leader and may want to test you, but for a patient, consistent owner, their loyalty and desire to please will help training go a bit more smoothly.Pugabulls are prone to weight gain, and they have high energy levels.

They are quite muscular for their size, which can make them a handful on walks if they aren't trained properly. They also have strong jaws, which they will use to chew out of boredom. Many a piece of furniture has been destroyed by an American Staffordshire Terrier that isn't physically and mentally stimulated enough. However, a confident, firm trainer that can meet the physical demands of the breed without harsh punishment will be rewarded with a calm, obedient dog that is comfortable with nose work, agility exercises, and athletic competitions, as well as just snuggling up on the couch. Although they are used as watchdogs, their natural love of humans makes the American Staffordshire Terrier's guarding ability more based on intimidation than anything else. Their muscular build and reputation as aggressive dogs act as deterrents from intruders, though that reputation is mostly undeserved. The American Staffordshire Terrier shares much in common with the American Pit Bull Terrier. Both have been used in illegal dog fighting rings, which makes them the targets of Breed Specific Legislation that bans them.

Because they're so large, they could accidentally injure a small child, especially when they're a clumsy, growing puppy (the phrase ""bull in a china shop"" applies).Additionally, the Anatolian typically does not respect children as pack leaders, and they could decide to protect their children from visiting playmates if they're roughhousing and the dog misinterprets the activity. Generally, the Anatolian is tolerant of older children and is good with them. To them, children are, of course, part of the flock that needs guarding, along with the rest of the family.The Anatolian Shepherd is not the perfect breed for everyone. They can be a fine and loyal companion if you and your family understand their unique qualities and requirements and are ready to take on the responsibility of owning a very large and protective dog.If you're looking to adopt an Anatolian Shepherd, meet them first and consult a breed expert to make sure you are ready for the challenge and responsibility."
Andrea Smith,Dog,Appenzeller Sennenhunde,https://cdn2-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2011/01/file_23244_what-is-the-appenzeller-sennenhunde-dog.jpg,Female,3,Available,"Also known as the Appenzeller Mountain Dog, this is the rarest of the four ancient Swiss mountain dog breeds. He got his start as an all-around farm dog _яс herding livestock, pulling carts, and guarding the farm _яс in the Appenzell region of Switzerland.Today the Appenzeller's known for being a versatile working and family dog who's smart, cheerful, self-assured, reliable, and fearless. His slight wariness around strangers and tendency to bark makes him a good watchdog, but he needs lots of early socialization so he doesn't become overly suspicious. And because of his barkiness, he's not the best dog if you have nearby neighbors.He's a great friend of children, but may nip at their heels as if they were livestock to be herded; younger Appenzellers are big and exuberant enough to accidentally knock over small kids.Because he's got a strong work ethic and lots of energy, this breed isn't suited to an inactive lifestyle. Provide him with training and a job or dog sport he can do, or he'll be an unhappy camper. Like other breeds that need lots of exercise and stimulation, he can grow bored and destructive if he doesn't get it. He excels at agility, herding, and obedience trials. At home, teach your Appenzeller to pull a cart with your gardening supplies."

Officially, however, he's the Australian Cattle Dog; the ""heeler"" moniker comes from the fact that the dogs were bred to herd cattle by nipping at their heels.The Australian Cattle Dog is a high-energy working dog. He is not a couch potato _яс we repeat: he is not a couch potato. He wants to be active and busy most of the time. His energy must be directed, or he'll become bored and will resort to entertaining himself, usually by doing something you consider naughty, like digging in the trash or digging up your flower garden.The Australian Cattle Dog is also highly devoted to his owner and family. He usually attaches himself closely to one person and bonds less closely with others. He's often called a ""Velcro"" dog because he attaches so firmly; he likes to be in close physical contact with his chosen person all the time.Because the Australian Cattle Dog was bred to herd, and herd with force, by biting, he is a mouthy dog. His instinct is to nip cattle, children, pets, cars, anything that moves. He has a strong tendency to bite, even in play. This tendency must be properly directed with socialization and training when he's a puppy, or it can turn into dangerous behavior.Another part of the breed's instinct is his strong prey drive. He's fascinated by squirrels, cats, and other small animals. If the Australian Cattle Dog is raised from puppyhood with other pets, including cats, he can be trusted to live peacefully with them in his home. He's likely to consider those outside his household to be fair game, though.The Australian Cattle Dog is generally friendly, but he is protective of his family and home turf, and he tends to be wary of strangers.There is a toughness about the Australian Cattle Dog _яс he had to be tough to handle the high temperatures, rough terrain, and long distances involved in his job on ranches _яс that makes him both highly tolerant of pain and intensely focused. He'll keep working even when he's injured. Owners must pay careful attention to this breed to make sure he stops working or competing if he gets hurt."
Daniel Short,Dog,Australian Kelpie,https://cdn1-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2018/04/australian-kelpie-dog-breed-pictures-header-460x260.jpg,Male,7,Available,"The Australian Kelpie is always ready to work. These dogs were made to withstand the heat and rugged conditions of Australia and work tirelessly all day to round up livestock, and they are still used for that purpose today. They are independent thinkers, which makes them well suited for herding without human supervision, but it can also mean trouble if they aren't challenged to do a specific task. Australian Kelpies need an outlet to use their mental and physical energy or they will create an outlet for themselves, which may include chewing, digging, or other destructive behavior. Their high energy and exercise requirements mean that they aren't the best suited breed for apartment life, and they can act out when left alone for long periods of time, though they may adapt well if they have a diligent owner who is present and gives plenty of walks and at least a good run each day. Training should begin early in life, especially socialization training, as Australian Kelpies can be highly territorial, and they may also nip while using their natural herding instincts. These qualities do, however, make them natural watchdogs. Without training, Australian Kelpies can be rambunctious and difficult to handle, but with proper guidance, all of their problematic tendencies can be honed into enormously useful and impressive skills, and their intelligence makes that training quite easy. Their grooming needs are fairly minimal, their health is generally good, and they are very loyal and loving companions for the right owners. Make sure you are ready to handle the Australian Kelpie's needs before you adopt, and you'll have an amazing friend for life."

You don't have to keep a flock of sheep if you live with an Aussie _яс although it doesn't hurt _яс but you do have to keep him busy. He's a high-energy dog who doesn't know the meaning of couch potato and wouldn't approve of it if he did.Because he's got energy to burn, he needs plenty of exercise _яс a walk around the neighborhood won't cut it _яс and at least a small yard to help him work out his ya-yas. Lacking a job to do, he becomes bored, destructive, and loud. Or he might invent his own job: herding the kids, either yours or the neighbors'; chasing cars or other animals; or taking your house apart. If you don't have the time or energy to train and exercise the Aussie on a daily basis, he's not the breed for you.But if you're interested in competitive dog sports, the Aussie's the one. This agile, medium-size dog with the docked or naturally bobbed tail is a top contender in all levels of obedience, agility, flyball, and herding tests. He's also successful in such canine careers as guide dog, hearing dog, assistance dog, police dog, and search and rescue work.You can even teach an Aussie to help you with chores around the house, such as picking up dirty laundry off the floor and bringing it to you. You'll probably have to fold clean laundry yourself, though.The Aussie's a real looker who stands out from the crowd thanks to his attractive medium-length coat and dark brown, yellow, blue, green, or amber eyes.His heritage as a working dog makes him a loyal companion who can be protective of home and family and aloof with strangers. He gets along with kids, although he'll probably try to ""herd"" them unless you teach him not to.The Aussie makes life an adventure.

Stephanie Spencer,Dog,Australian Terrier,https://cdn3-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2011/01/file_23054_australian-terrier-460x290.jpg,Male,9,Available,"The Australian Terrier, called an ""Aussie"" by his admirers (although he's not to be confused with an Australian Shepherd), is a small terrier with upright ears and a rough, shaggy coat. He is the littlest of the working terriers, but don't let his size fool you. He's definitely a lot of dog in a tiny package, with a typical terrier slant on life: tenacious, independent, hardworking, and lively.With a spirited, mischievous personality, the Aussie jumps into life with attitude. But he's usually strongly attached to his family _яс so strongly attached that he'll often match his mood to yours. If you've got the blues, he is calm and quiet. If you're happy and excited, he turns frisky and playful.Mostly, the Aussie is upbeat, active, and silly, clowning around and entertaining his owners. He has an affinity for the young, the elderly, and the disabled. He makes an excellent playmate for a child, although adults should supervise interactions with very young children: Australian Terriers are not snappy or aggressive, but they do have limits on the handling and roughhousing they will tolerate.He may be small, but the Australian Terrier has the confidence of a large breed. He is a wonderful watchdog and will bark to alert his owners of the approach of anyone or anything new and different.Since they're so intelligent, Australian Terriers will readily learn whatever you're teaching (so be sure you don't inadvertently teach your Aussie pup that it's okay to jump up on you or chase the cat _яс or he'll keep up the behavior throughout his adulthood as well). Repetitive training is a bore for these bundles of energy, so lessons must be fun and increasingly challenging. Also, the independent Aussie likes to think the schooling is all his idea. Positive, reward-based training works wonders.Since the breed was developed as a working terrier, the Aussie instinct to chase and kill small animals _яс including squirrels, rabbits, mice, and cats _яс is strong. A securely fenced yard is essential, as is leash training. If you have rodents or other small pets, you need to introduce your Aussie to them when he's a young puppy, and teach him from the start that they are off limits. This can be very difficult _яс in truth, the best strategy is to never allow the Aussie to gain access to them. He can live with cats if he grows up with them and is taught to leave them alone, but he's likely to consider all felines outside your household to be fair game.If you like a pristine lawn or showplace garden, an Australian Terrier may not be the breed for you. Like all terriers, he loves to dig _яс it's in his breeding _яс and if left unsupervised for too long, he'll decide that tearing up the lawn is an ideal way to amuse himself.Even though he stands a mere 10 inches tall and weighs about 14 pounds, this is one confident breed. The spunky Aussie will challenge other dogs, including those much bigger than he is. He can be aggressive and bossy to other dogs in his household."

They're also protective of their people and property. Fans describe them as a wonderful combination of loyal and independent.Because they're sighthounds, they're attracted by motion and are likely to chase animals, people on bicycles or skateboards, or even running children. On the other hand, these lean, muscular dogs make excellent companions for joggers and runners. Indoors, they're fairly inactive and are content to snooze on the couch.They're best suited to a home with a large fenced yard or a nearby fenced park where they can run flat out. They need at least a half hour a day of active exercise or play and, although it may seem like a slight to their dignity, you'll need to outfit your Azawakh in a sweater before heading out in cold weather.

He real name comes from the French word barbe, meaning beard, due to his bearded face.The Barbet is no newcomer _яс the first written reference to the breed dates back to 1387, although the breed may have originated as early as the eighth century. For centuries the Barbet served as a water retriever for royalty and commoner alike, and his thick, waterproof coat helped earn him a reputation for braving the chilliest water. King Henry IV was one royal fan, and legend has it that the king's mistress was once reproached for bringing a Barbet to church.In addition to his retrieving skills, the Barbet is cherished for his versatility and his joyful, intelligent personality.

Jasmine Nelson,Dog,Basenji,https://cdn3-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2011/01/file_23008_basenji-460x290.jpg,Male,6,Available,"Well known as the ""barkless"" dog from Africa, the Basenji attracts admirers with his short coat, small, muscular body, alert demeanor, erect ears, and tail curled tightly over one hip. A wrinkled brow gives him a quizzical and sometimes mischievous expression.All that sounds attractive, but people who don't research the Basenji before acquiring one may be disappointed or frustrated when they aren't prepared for the Basenji's unique temperament and personality. Obtaining a Basenji from a reputable breeder who will discuss the pros and cons of living with this breed will give you a reality check, and such a breeder is also more likely to check breeding stock for heritable health problems breeding them.The Basenji is highly intelligent, but he has a stubborn streak a mile wide. The phrase ""willing to please,"" used to describe so many breeds, is unknown to him. A Basenji may know perfectly well all the commands you teach him, but whether he actually performs them will always be in question. He may think first and then obey, or he may decide there's really no good reason to do as you ask. Instead, Basenjis use their intelligence to demand your attention and get you to provide whatever it is they need or want.Basenji people say their breed is good at teaching you to pick up your house. Anything left out where the dog can find it is fair game to be chewed or eaten. You'll soon learn to protect your belongings by putting them out of reach of these inquisitive dogs.Basenjis are also escape artists. Even a fenced yard will not contain a Basenji who is determined to be elsewhere. Unsupervised time alone in a yard could mean the loss of your treasured companion as he takes off to explore the world. Underground electronic fences also will not contain a Basenji who sees or smells something interesting. He considers the jolt from the collar a minor inconvenience.The Basenji is known for not barking, but that doesn't mean he's silent. His vocalizations range from a delightful yodel to a hair-raising scream, as well as the usual growls, whimpers, and whines made by all dogs.On the plus side, Basenjis love to play, although if you want a dog who'll fetch a Frisbee or tennis ball, look elsewhere _яс the Basenji is not for you. They are clean dogs with almost feline grooming habits. If you keep an immaculate home, you will appreciate that Basenjis shed very little. They also make excellent watchdogs. They will defend their people and property when challenged. They are noted for their courage and will stand against an intruder with everything they have. That said, their size precludes them from being an actual guard dog.If you'd like to take up an activity with your dog, Basenjis are aces at the sport of lure coursing, the perfect game for these dogs who hunt by sight and love to chase. In it, they follow a lure _яс usually a white plastic bag _яс over a course in a field. The lure is tied to a line that is run by a series of pulleys as the dogs give chase. Agility is another sport that might suit the Basenji's love of a good time. While Basenjis don't excel in obedience competition, they can be successful if you can come up with a creative way to make them think that training and competition is their idea.Basenjis are also super show dogs thanks to their proud manner and striking copper coat. They're easy to prepare for the show ring and have no need for trimming or complicated grooming. If you want a dog to show in the breed ring, discuss this with your breeder before purchase so she can help you choose the right puppy.With his unique appearance and personality, the Basenji is not the breed for everyone, but for those who appreciate this little dog's attitude and intelligence, he can be the ideal companion. Who knows? You may even join the ranks of Basenji people who brag about the destruction their dogs can wreak."

Daniel Mills,Dog,Basset Hound,https://cdn2-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2011/01/file_23010_basset-hound-460x290.jpg,Male,5,Available,"He may be best known as the Hush Puppy dog, but the Basset Hound is much more than an advertising icon. With his placid personality and short-statured yet noble appearance, the Basset Hound is a popular family companion, as well as a slow-paced but keen hunting dog.The name Basset comes from the French word bas, meaning low. And Basset Hounds certainly are low to the ground. Because their bones are heavy and they are muscular, they usually weigh 50 to 65 pounds although they typically are no more than 14 inches tall at the highest point of the shoulder. In reality, they are big dogs on short legs. Their short-legged appearance is the result of a form of dwarfism called achondroplasia. Despite his large size, the Basset believes he's a lap dog and will do his best to fit in yours.Bassets are scent hounds, meaning that they were bred to hunt by following the scent of their prey. Their phenomenal sense of smell is second only to that of the Bloodhound.Basset Hounds have smooth, short, hard-textured coats that are relatively easy to take care of. Most of them come in the classic tri-color pattern of black, tan, and white, but they can also be what's known as open red and white (red spots on a white coat), closed red and white (solid red with white feet and tail), or lemon and white. On occasion you may see a gray (also called blue) Basset, but this color is considered undesirable because it's thought to be associated with genetic problems.The Basset Hound has a rounded skull with a deep muzzle and a lot of loose skin on the face, which is heavily wrinkled over the brow when the dog is tracking. This loose skin also causes Bassets to have a sad look, which many people think adds to their charm.Because they were originally bred to be hunting dogs, many of the features of the Basset Hounds have a purpose. Their long, low-set ears drag the ground and pick up scents, while the loose skin around their heads form wrinkles that further capture the scent of whatever they are tracking.Their short legs mean that they move more slowly than longer-legged dogs, which makes it easier for hunters on foot to follow them. Their tails are long and stand upright with a white tip at the end, which makes it easy for hunters to see when the dogs are in tall grass. Basset Hounds also have massive paws and their front feet turn outward slightly to balance the width of the shoulders.Around the house, Basset Hounds are calm and rather lazy. They are loyal to their people and have a pleasant, friendly disposition. Because they originally were bred as pack dogs, they love to be with their families and also do well with other pets. Bassets hate to be left alone for long periods of time, and may become destructive and howl if left alone for too long. Their distinctive baying bark is loud and travels long distances.Basset Hounds are hearty eaters, but because they aren't very active in the house, they can gain weight and quickly become obese, which can cause them to have back and leg problems. Regular exercise is a must. Bassets have a great deal of endurance, so they enjoy taking long walks.When you're walking your Basset, be aware that he loves to track. If he picks up a scent that he wants to follow, he can wander off if not on leash. Bassets are singleminded when trailing a scent and will follow it into the street in front of a car if they're not leashed or confined by a fence.Lots of Basset people channel their dogs' superb scent-trailing skills in organized tracking events called basseting, which take place primarily in Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. Bassets are naturals at earning tracking, hunt test, and field trial titles, but they've also been known to compete successfully in agility, obedience, and rally, given a patient trainer.Patience is definitely a virtue when it comes to training a Basset. Unless you can persuade him that it's something he wants to do, he can be stubborn and difficult to train. Many Basset Hounds will obey commands when offered food, but won't obey if you don't have a tasty reward to offer them.Housetraining a Basset is a challenge too, but with patience and persistence, you can train and housetrain your Basset. Just be sure to use gentle, positive training methods. Basset Hounds are emotionally sensitive and will shut down if treated roughly.Basset Hounds have unique voices. They generally howl (sometimes called a bay) rather than bark. They also have a unique, murmuring whine that they use when they want attention or are begging for food. Thanks to their delightfully imploring expressions, they're often successful at winning treats of Chinese food, pizza, French fries, and other tasty junk food.Well-bred Bassets are even-tempered, relaxed, and generally happy dogs. They are very gentle with children and other pets. Their biggest faults are their tendency to drool and to howl when lonely or to sound an alarm. If you can tolerate his idiosyncrasies, the Basset can make a wonderful family companion, as happy to lounge around the house as he is to be out hunting."

They're happy, outgoing and loving _яс characteristics more than balanced out by their hound nature, which is inquisitive, determined, and focused on food.They aren't yappy dogs, but they do have three distinct vocalizations _яс a bark/growl, a baying howl, and a half-baying howl (a cross between a frantic bark and a bay). The half-howl vocalization usually is reserved for when they catch sight of quarry _яс or think it's time to wake the neighbors at 6 a.m.! Being pack dogs, they generally get along well with other animals and their human friends _яс and they think everyone is their new best friend.The most important thing to know about the Beagle is that he is a scenthound. His nose is the most important part of his anatomy and his head is always down to the ground, searching for an interesting trail to follow. Beagles have approximately 220 million scent receptors compared to the paltry 5 million or so in people, which makes them very good at picking up scents. Humorist Dave Barry once described his in-laws' Beagle as ""a nose with feet.""You may have seen the Beagle's nose at work at airports across the country. In 1984, the U.S. Department of Agriculture decided to use Beagles to sniff out contraband food being brought into the United States at the Los Angeles International Airport.The experiment was a huge success. Because they are small, friendly, and cute, the Beagles didn't intimidate people who are afraid of dogs, and with their super nose power, they could be trained to identify specific food articles while bypassing those that weren't contraband. Today, members of the ""Beagle Brigade"" patrol the baggage-claim areas at more than 20 international airports and other points of entry into the United States.Although they've branched out into other fields of work, Beagles remain superb hunters of small game. The National Beagle Club's Institute Farm hosts AKC-sanctioned field trials where breeders with packs are put to the test in the field. Many other countries have similar activities for hunting Beagles.Because of their small size and gentle temperament, Beagles can do well in apartments if their people are willing to walk them on lead several times a day in all kinds of weather. They need plenty of exercise, about an hour a day if possible. If left alone and unexercised, Beagles can become destructive."
Mary Mcneil,Dog,Bearded Collie,https://cdn2-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2011/01/file_23170_bearded-collie-460x290.jpg,Female,3,Available,"When anyone describes a Bearded Collie, the adjective most often used is enthusiastic! That word, along with hardy, exuberant, active, energetic, bright, reliable, and trustworthy should give you the beginnings of a picture of this well-loved breed. The Bearded Collie, known affectionately as the Beardie, is the ultimate shaggy dog. The name Bearded Collie comes from the hair that hangs down from the chin and forms a beard.The Beardie's enthusiasm is displayed in his bouncy nature. It's said that Beardies working in thick undergrowth in Scotland would bounce up to see where the sheep were and that when confronted by stubborn sheep they bark and bounce in front of it to get it to move. Whatever the case, Bearded Collies bounce along through life with a constantly wagging tail and an upbeat, clownish attitude.Nonetheless, they're not the breed for everyone. Beardies are highly intelligent, active and resourceful. It takes a smart and energetic person to keep up with them. People who live with Beardies must enjoy brushing long hair and be willing to deal with a beard of hair that drips water after every drink and hairy feet that track in mud and debris after every venture outdoors. Bearded Collies are sociable and will demand to be included in all family activities, indoors or out. A bored Beardie will put his considerable intelligence and energy into causing trouble.Bearded Collies are excellent with children; their high energy level makes them active playmates who will spend hours running and playing. They are rambunctious, however, and young children should always be supervised when interacting with any breed of dog to prevent injury to both.Beardies are outgoing, affectionate dogs, but they can have a stubborn and independent streak from a heritage that required them to make their own decisions while herding sheep. Obedience training is a must if you are going to establish order and discipline in your dog's life. Make learning fun, and teach them with positive reinforcement techniques such as food rewards, play, and praise. Bearded Collies do not learn under abusive or harsh conditions. Begin training early and you will obtain excellent results.Because of their herding heritage, Beardies are alert and make good watchdogs, barking to let you know that someone has arrived. They'll also bark to tell you that they're happy or excited or that they're bored or alone and would like some attention. Teach them to control their barking when they're young, or you'll have a nuisance barker on your hands.Beardies will include other animals in their family ""flock"" if introduced to them properly, preferably when young. Being herding dogs, they're always open for a game of chase the cat if the cat wants to play, and sometimes even when it doesn't! They are not dog-aggressive and will play happily with other dogs from Chihuahuas to Great Danes.If you're looking to add a little Beardie bounce into your life and you believe after meeting some Beardies and breeders that this is the breed for you, then you can look forward to having an active, lively companion for 12 to 14 years. A Bearded Collie is always ready for whatever is up next, whether that is competing in the show ring or in obedience or agility trials, herding sheep as an occupation or for herding trials, chasing Frisbees in the backyard, playing with the kids, or hanging with the family. A Bearded Collie is ready to do it all."
John King,Dog,Bedlington Terrier,https://cdn1-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2011/01/file_23056_bedlington-terrier-460x290.jpg,Male,8,Available,"The Bedlington Terrier captures your attention with his unique lamblike appearance and keeps it with his entertaining, opinionated personality. Don't let his appearance fool you, however. The Bedlington is all terrier: inquisitive, intelligent, alert, and aggressive toward small animals outdoors.Bedlingtons throw themselves with enthusiasm into the activities of their family. They love to be the center of attention and will play the clown to get it. Bedlingtons welcome guests and entertain them with their antics, but they'll let you know if they think someone's shady. Bedlington people say their dogs have astute judgment and make excellent watchdogs.Exercise is important to keep a Bedlington happy and healthy, but he has moderate energy levels and activity needs. He'll match his activity level to yours and can be satisfied with a nice walk or vigorous game of fetch. He can jog with you or go on a hike. Although he's rarely used in the field, his hunting abilities include pointing, retrieving, tracking, and, of course, going to ground after den animals. Whatever you do with him, he's happy to be a couch potato afterward.When he's raised with children, the Bedlington can be an energetic playmate. Make sure extremely young children are supervised by an adult when interacting with any dog to prevent injury to both. While a Bedlington will tolerate a certain amount of rough handling, he will set limits when things get too rough, and he doesn't understand that a child's skin isn't as tough as another dog's.Bedlingtons can get along well with other dogs, especially if they're raised with them. Like most terriers, they might not start a fight, but they won't back down from one. The Bedlington may look fluffy and sweet, but he's no pushover and won't accept readily another dog's attempt to dominate him. Bedlingtons can be fierce fighters if aroused, so be cautious when introducing them to new canine companions, especially other adults of the same sex. Male Bedlingtons especially will persist in a fight until major damage is done.The Bedlington is intelligent, and that intelligence makes him only moderately easy to train. He does best when you can persuade him that doing what you want is really his idea or benefits him in some way. Use positive reinforcement techniques such as praise, play, and food rewards. Harsh words and physical force will not work with this breed, as they will only bring out his stubborn streak and begin a battle of wills that you will probably lose. Nonetheless, Bedlingtons have competed successfully in the obedience ring. They view the agility ring as an excellent opportunity show off their speed, grace, and enthusiasm. And naturally your Bedlington will love Earth Dog competitions in which he can display his terrier tenacity and willingness to find prey underground.With proper training and socialization, the Bedlington is an excellent companion and enthusiastic partner in all family activities. You will appreciate his sense of humor and eagerness to get the most out of life."
Leah Stout,Dog,Belgian Malinois,https://cdn1-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2011/01/file_23172_belgian-malinois-460x290.jpg,Female,7,Available,"The Belgian Malinois (pronounced MAL-in-wah) is a medium-size Belgian shepherd dog that at first glance resembles a German Shepherd Dog. Malinois are shorthaired, fawn-colored dogs with a black mask. They are one of four types of Belgian herding dogs, and have been shown in the U.S. as a separate breed since 1959.Originally developed in Malines, Belgium, Malinois have a great deal of stamina and truly enjoy working. They are intelligent and very active dogs that excel at many tasks. In addition to herding, they also do well with police work, search and rescue, and in performance events, such as agility.People who are not familiar with the Malinois often confuse him with the German Shepherd Dog (GSD), but there are significant differences in the body structure and temperament of the two breeds. Malinois are smaller dogs with lighter bones. They stand with their weight well on their toes, which gives them a square body profile, while today's GSD has a long, sloping back and carries his weight flatter on his feet.Malinois are fawn-colored, red, or brown, and the tips of their hair are black, while the GSD is usually tan with a black saddle. Additionally, the Malinois has a more refined, chiseled head that the GSD and smaller, more triangular ears.Many think that the Malinois is more alert and quicker to respond than the GSD. They're also very sensitive dogs that don't respond well to harsh training methods. Some Malinois are friendly and assertive, but others are reserved and aloof with strangers. They should never have a fearful or aggressive temperament. Because of their energy level and sensitivity, Malinois are recommended only for people who have previously owned dogs and have experience with dog training. Malinois are very intense dogs who like to be included in all of the family activities. They aren't well suited for people who work long hours or must travel often, leaving their dog at home.If you have decided that the Malinois is the breed for you, you should expose yours to many different people, dogs, other animals and situations as early as possible. Puppy kindergarten classes are recommended for your Malinois puppy, followed by obedience training class.Malinois are quick learners and eager to do whatever their people ask of them. They excel are obedience, tracking, agility, flyball, herding, showing, Schutzhund and other protection sports, search and rescue, and police work. Trainers describe them as having a high ""play drive,"" which means that they love to play, and about anything you ask them to do is play to them.But the Malinois' owner should never forget that this is a breed that was developed to protect and herd. Poorly bred Malinois or ones that have been poorly socialized may be aggressive out of fear or shyness. Additionally, although well-socialized Malinois are good with children, especially if they are raised with them, they may have a tendency to nip at their heels and try to herd them when playing."

Elegant and graceful, he has a long black coat and an imposing appearance. He's athletic as well as beautiful and maintains the working ability for which he was originally known, making him an excellent choice for agility, herding, and obedience competitions.The Belgian Sheepdog combines the versatility of a working dog with the gentleness of a family companion. He makes a wonderful family companion as long as he receives the exercise he needs.Of all the traits this breed has, energy is at the top of the list of what to consider before you purchase. The Belgian Sheepdog is not a breed that enjoys lazing around the house; he's a working dog and needs a job to do. Herding dogs such as the Belgian Sheepdog are hard-wired to chase after a flock of sheep all day long. That instinct doesn't disappear just because they're living in a family home instead. Expect to give him at least an hour of exercise per day. The Belgian Sheepdog is very intelligent and needs variety to keep from becoming bored. He's not a good choice for people who work long hours and have no way of exercising their dog during the day. If he's left to his own devices, he's likely to create his own entertainment _яс generally something you won't like that will be expensive to repair _яс or to develop separation anxiety.They do better in homes with a fenced yard. Their herding heritage makes Belgian Sheepdogs chasers, and they'll take off after joggers, bicyclists, and cars if they aren't contained by a fence.Loving and loyal, the Belgian Sheepdog will always protect ""his"" children, but it's important for parents to supervise play when neighboring children are around. The Belgian may mistake the noise and high spirits of play as an assault and try to nip at your child's friends. With proper supervision and corrections, you can teach him that this isn't appropriate behavior. Belgian Sheepdogs do best with children when they're raised with them from puppyhood or socialized to them at an early age.They can get along well with other dogs and cats if they're brought up with them, although they may have issues with strange animals that come onto their property. They love to chase _яс that herding instinct again! _яс so cats who stand their ground will probably fare better than those who turn tail and run.This versatile dog has many excellent characteristics, but he's probably not suited to a first-time dog owner.

The Belgian Tervuren is a beautiful, medium-size dog with a long, rich fawn to russet mahogany coat superimposed with a blanket of black, giving the Terv a striking appearance. He has the same athletic body and seemingly endless well of energy that characterizes all the Belgian shepherd breeds.The Terv is a charmer, noted for his intelligence, elegance, alertness, and sense of humor. He stands his ground in the face of strangers, sure of his ability to protect his people and property. With his own family, he's affectionate and demanding of their time and attention. This is a dog who loves to be doing things with you.And he can do a lot of things. The Terv isn't just a herding dog anymore. He does police work, is an accomplished assistance dog and therapy dog, and participates in any number of dog sports, from herding _яс natch! _яс to agility, obedience, sledding (yes, sledding), and tracking. The breed standard _яс the written description of how a dog should look and act _яс says a Tervuren is usually in motion when not under command. Take that description to heart if you are considering a Terv!The Belgian Tervuren is not typically recommended for people who are inexperienced with dogs. His temperament and activity level can be overwhelming to people who haven't had a working dog before. Herding dogs such as the Tervuren are hard-wired to chase after a flock of sheep all day long. That instinct doesn't disappear just because they're living in a family home instead. The Terv requires a good hour of exercise each day and enough mental stimulation to keep him from being bored. If he's left to his own devices all day, he's likely to create his own entertainment _яс generally something you won't like that will be expensive to repair _яс or to develop separation anxiety.While the Terv is smart and highly trainable, he is an independent thinker. To succeed in training him, you'll need to earn his trust and respect without the use of anger, intimidation, or physical force. For all his confidence and strength, the Tervuren is sensitive, and his temperament can be damaged, sometimes irreparably, by harsh corrections. He does best with a combination of firm, fair, consistent rules and rewards for correct behavior.Tervs are devoted to their families, including children, but they're more interested in hanging with the adults. They can get along well with other dogs and cats if they're brought up with them, although they may have issues with strange animals that come onto their property. They love to chase _яс that herding instinct, again! _яс so cats who stand their ground will probably fare better than those who turn tail and run.

The breed inherits the intelligence of its Poodle parents and the charming, goofy, happy-go-lucky temperament of the Bernese Mountain Dog. Bernedoodles are happiest when they're spending time with their families, children included, and are willing participants in playtime and cuddle fests alike.The breed hasn't been around for long, so it may be difficult to accurately make predictions about individual dogs. Sometimes they get more Poodle traits, and other times they more closely resemble the Bernese. That said, fans of Bernedoodles adore their friendliness, playfulness, intelligence, and affection. They also tend to be more hypoallergenic, which is a blessing for allergy sufferers.In addition to their personalities, Bernedoodles can differ in appearance. Their coats can be curly and wavy or straight and come in a variety of colors. They come in three sizes; tiny, miniature, and standard. These sizes are determined by the size of the Poodle parent, which can be toy, mini, or standard.Bernedoodles are fairly adaptable and go with the flow. Smaller sized Bernedoodles make better apartment pets than Standard Bernedoodles, who do best with a yard to burn off energy. This breed has moderate exercise needs that are usually met with at least one long daily walk.If you need a dog for the whole family, or if you're a single owner looking for a lovable, smart mixed-breed with good health that will put a smile on your face with their antics, you won't be able to find a much better choice than the Bernedoodle."

Underneath that beautiful coat is a sturdy dog well suited for heavy work: These beautiful, gentle dogs have been traditionally used in Switzerland as herders and draft dogs.The Berner was originally a vital part of farm life, serving to drive cattle, protect family, and pull carts loaded with goods to sell at nearby villages. Although they're good-mannered, hard workers, they nearly became extinct in the early 20th century, when other means of transportation became accessible to farmers.

The Berner needs to live with their family, rather than be relegated to an outdoor kennel. They're happiest when they can participate in all family activities.Since they were bred to be a working dog, the Berner likes to learn and can be easily trained. Since they are very large_ясusually about 100 pounds_ясwhen mature, early obedience training and socialization are recommended. Prospective owners should know that the Berner is slow to mature, both physically and mentally; they may remain puppyish for some time.

Bichons also appear to have originated in the Mediterranean and to have been taken along on trade routes into other countries.Bichons may be small dogs _яс large specimens reach barely a foot in height _яс but they're hardy. Despite their diminutive size, they're not classified as a Toy breed by the American Kennel Club; instead, they're members of the Non-Sporting Group.Bichons are always white (although puppies may be cream or pale yellow), with black eyes and black noses. Their arched necks give them a proud, confident look, while their well-plumed tails curve gracefully over their backs.If you're looking for a wonderful family pet, consider the Bichon. This dog loves to play. He's always happy (except when left alone for long periods of time), and his demeanor is affectionate and gentle.Because they don't shed like other breeds, Bichons often are recommended for people with allergies. This is something you should discuss with your allergist, since not everyone reacts the same way to a Bichon. Before making a commitment to getting a Bichon _яс or any type of dog _яс be sure to spend some time in the presence of the breed if you have allergies.Bichons have a reputation for suffering from separation anxiety. If you must leave your dog home alone for long periods of time, this may not be the dog for you. Bichons don't just like to be with their families, they need to be with their families. They adjust well to a variety of lifestyles, as long as they don't have to spend too much time alone.Because of their small size, Bichons are good pets for people who live in apartments. But they do have a lot of energy, and they need daily exercise, including walks and games.Bichons are intelligent and love to learn tricks, and they're highly trainable. When training, you need to be firm but gentle. Harsh corrections and scolding will break a Bichon's heart. Many Bichon owners train their dogs for obedience, agility, and rally competition. Both dogs and owners enjoy this activity, and it's a good way to bond more closely with your Bichon. Another activity that brings out the best in the Bichon is therapy work.

Of the six coonhound breeds, the Black and Tan is the one most frequently recognized, notable for his size and distinctive coloring. Among hunters, he's famous for his cold nose; that is, the ability to pick up and follow an old trail, no matter how faint.Because of his strong hunting instinct and specialized skills, the Black and Tan Coonhound is rarely thought of as a family dog. Still, for people who admire the hound's independent nature and sense of humor, he can make an excellent companion and at home he tends to be laidback, playful, and gentle.The stamina that makes this Hound a great hunting dog also makes him an excellent jogging or running companion. But he's equally satisfied with a good daily walk, especially if there's plenty of sniffing time built in. Afterward, expect him to sack out on the sofa, preferably in or near your lap. This is a dog who likes his comforts.Black and Tan Coonhounds are fond of children and willing playmates. They get along well with other dogs and can even be buddies with cats if properly introduced. They possess good watchdog skills, and are likely to sound off with a deep-throated bark to alert you that someone's approaching. This dog is big enough to look intimidating, but unlikely to bite or otherwise harm anyone.As with every breed, Coonhounds have some drawbacks. For one thing, they can have a houndy odor. This is something you'll either love or hate. Be sure you love it, because it can't be washed away for more than a day or two.Also, these dogs can sing. No, you're not getting the Mormon Tabernacle Choir here but the deep bay of a hound who's treed a squirrel, cat, or other furry animal foolish enough to enter your yard. Lots of people love the music of the hounds, but those people might not include your neighbors.Nor is this a breed for the houseproud. Black and Tan Coonhounds drool when it's hot, slobber after drinking water, and shed heavily.Finally, he's not for the faint of heart. A Coonhound needs a leader who's as stubborn and smart as he is.Still, if you can have a sense of humor and can accept his drawbacks, plus provide the Black and Tan with the human companionship he loves, moderate daily exercise, and firm, consistent, patient training, it's hard not to fall in love with this breed."

These dogs are known for their courage, loyalty, and strength, though they are also quite sensitive and are highly intuitive when it comes to knowing how their humans are feeling.The Black Mouth Cur requires an experienced owner with a Goldilocks approach to training. Owners must be firm, but not overly punitive or harsh to find a balance that is just right. These dogs have high exercise needs and do best with a large yard where they can run in addition to being provided with at least one long walk per day, lest they become bored and destructive in the home. They interact well with people and other dogs, though they are highly territorial and may respond aggressively to perceived intruders or threats to their family.

An innate protective instinct is developed by the time they are a year old.When combined with the size, agility, courage, and power of this gorgeous bearded beauty, that instinct creates an outstanding guard dog who loves to play with their family's kids and hang out by your side. Blackies demand and thrive on human attention and affection, and they'll wait at the back door until you let them in because playing is just no fun without people.The Black Russian is a working dog who responds best to firm and consistent training. You have to respect them or they won't tolerate your command. Without a job to do and lacking adequate early training, a Blackie could easily become bored and destructive, and at that size, they could do some real damage.They're so smart, it's scary. If you feel that you can't live with a dog who is smarter than you are, then the Black Russian Terrier might not be a good choice. Remember that the breed has historically been used to work for the military and police (although these days they're most often found protecting home and hearth).That intelligence means they train quickly but can have a real stubborn streak, so you need to be the one in charge from the get-go. If you're into performance competitions, such as agility, obedience, or Schutzhund, this pup is a natural performer who knows how to work a crowd. They'll also excel at search and rescue.The Blackie is slow to mature, like most big dogs. TheyК_housetrainК_easily, and they don't need to be leash-trained, as they'll follow naturally while on a leash. They're also much more active outside than in the house.They can't be left outside to live in a kennel; they're just too people-oriented. Besides, some day they could start defending their kennel against you rather than defending your home. They have to see your home as their own in order to protect it.Calm and quiet, the Blackie tends to be aloof with strangers, but not aggressive or shy toward them. They'll accept a stranger you admit into the household, but they'll take their time considering whether such a person should be a friend. However, if they feel the stranger is threatening, then all bets are off--they won't waste a moment hesitating to defend those they love.Because the Blackie is so intelligent, stubborn, and large, they aren't a good choice for first-time dog owners. For example, if you don't want your adult Blackie on the furniture or in your bed, you need to start out right by not allowing the puppy to be in those places. They won't give up those habits once they've gotten away with them a time or two--their stubborn streak is just too strong.In some, that streak can be so deep that it doesn't allow them to compromise at all. That means the Black Russian Terrier is best suited to experienced dog people used to large, dominant guard dogs. They'll walk all over people they can intimidate--they are large and in charge. Bred to work as a partner with their owner, they are a thinking dog who responds better to logic than to force. Positive reinforcement is best with these pups. But for those who know how to train and live with a powerful, smart guard dog, the Blackie is a wonderful choice."

The Bloodhound is indeed single-minded on the trail, but what many people don't realize is that once he's found his quarry, he might lick the person to death, but he'll never attack.This wrinkled hound is gentle and affectionate, but he's far from lazy. He can follow a scent trail for miles and will always prefer that to sleeping on the sun porch. Expect to commit to long walks every day if you live with a Bloodhound.The Bloodhound belongs to a group of dogs that hunt together by scent, known as Sagaces, from the Latin, which is the same root as the word ""sagacious,"" referring to the qualities of keen discernment and sound judgment. Those words are certainly descriptive of the Bloodhound's powers of scent.Originally used in medieval Europe to trail boar and deer, modern-day Bloodhounds have found careers as mantrailers for police departments and search and rescue organizations. So skillful are they that their ""testimony"" is considered admissible in a court of law. He can be a family dog, too, but he requires a high level of care.It's not everyone who can live with a large dog who slings slobber, exudes a distinctive houndy odor, wants nothing more than to follow his nose, wreaks destruction in puppyhood, has endless energy and endurance, and is the definition of the word stubborn. If you can, you'll find the Bloodhound to be kind, sensitive, and tolerant of children and other animals. With the right family, he's a dog of great character who brings much joy and laughter."
Abigail Ochoa,Dog,Blue Lacy,https://cdn3-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2018/04/blue-lacy-dog-breed-pictures-header-460x260.jpg,Male,2,Available,"High energy might be the first thing that comes to mind when talking about Blue Lacys, and they require multiple long runs and walks each day to burn off all that energy. They often need a job to do, whether it be hunting, herding, agility training, or acting as a watchdog, or else they may get bored and act out, as is the case with many intelligent and energetic dog breeds. Physical and mental stimulation are must-haves each day for the Blue Lacy. If you live in an apartment or you don't have a task in mind for these dogs, you may want to look for another breed. While the Blue Lacy is a loving family dog, they are not for novice owners, nor are they for families with small pets or very young children, as they have a high prey drive and a high level of intensity. They require early socialization and capable training, though they are very sensitive and do not respond well to yelling, harsh rebukes, or punishment. Highly territorial, somewhat distrustful of strangers, and eager to chase anything that moves, Blue Lacys make excellent watchdogs, though socialization training is highly necessary so they know when it is appropriate to be on guard and when to be friendly to other pets and people. The Blue Lacy will work as hard and tirelessly as you ask them to, and they are perfectly suited for the farm and hunting work that they were bred to do, as well as agility training or even search and rescue jobs. If you know what you're doing, you'll have a well-trained, intelligent, adaptable companion that would do just about anything for you."

The Boerboel breed is descended from dogs brought by Dutch settlers to South Africa who defended the homestead from hyenas, lions, leopards, and other dangerous wildlife. Today, they are prized as watchdogs, guardians, and competitors in canine competitions, as well as highly protective family companions that adore kids. They can, however, be quite territorial, and without proper training and socialization, they can exhibit aggressive tendencies to strangers and other dogs. Boerboels require plenty of mental and physical exercise. Being surprisingly agile for their size and very intelligent, their need for stimulation of both mind and body is high. Leaving them alone for too long can result in boredom and anxiety, which can lead to destructive behavior. They need a home that can accommodate their size and exercise needs and a trainer who is patient and confident. In the right home, they can be an invaluable watchdog and affectionate pet for the whole family."

It is awe-inspiring.The Border Collie, a medium-sized dog at 30 to 45 pounds, possesses a seemingly supernatural amount of energy and stamina _яс a hardiness that was developed when he was required to work all day in the hills and valleys of the rugged Scottish border country, sometimes running 50 miles or more a day. When it comes to the ideal working dog, it doesn't get much better than the Border Collie.If there is a dark side to the Border Collie's energy and workaholic attitude, it comes out when he's brought into a family that doesn't understand him. He is not a cuddly, couch-potato dog. He doesn't want to be coddled. He wants _яс and needs _яс a job. Keeping up with the Border Collie's intense mental and physical stamina is exhausting, even exasperating, to an owner or family that wants a laid-back family pet.The Border Collie is a herding dog, which means he has an overwhelming urge to gather a flock. That flock could be sheep, children, cats, squirrels, or anything that moves, including cars. This instinct to nip, nudge, and bark, along with his energy, cannot be trained out of him. Rather, it must be directed. He must have a task, whether it's actually herding sheep or competing in dog sports. A brisk walk or a game of fetch every day isn't enough activity for the Border Collie.That said, for the right owner, a Border Collie is a wonderful dog to live with. His intelligence and tractable nature make him easy to train. He's sensitive and, according to those who know him well, he has an uncanny ability to know what you're going to ask of him before you ask it. If he is well socialized and trained from puppyhood, he can adapt to almost any living situation that provides the mental and physical exercise he requires.The Border Collie is a good match for an owner who is as active as he is, especially one who's eager to get involved in dog sports. With the right training, this breed excels in any activity he tries, including sheepdog trials, agility, flyball, flying disc, advanced obedience, freestyle obedience, or tracking.The owner or family that's willing to properly socialize and train the Border Collie will find a soul mate in this intelligent, sensitive breed."

The Border Terrier is not for everyone, and before taking one home, you should be fully committed to taking his antics in stride with an amused shake of your head.But for the right people, Border Terriers are wonderful dogs who play hard and love harder. They're ideally suited to active families who can give them plenty of exercise and prevent them from practicing their escape-artist skills.Border Terriers need a securely fenced yard to keep them safe. Given a lack of supervision and enough time alone, they'll dig under or climb over fences to go exploring. They'll escape through holes in fences, through open gates and doors, or by any other means they can find. In fact, they're bred to be able to cross any wall or scramble through any wire entanglement.The drive to chase prey is another inherent part of a Border Terrier's personality. He'll run right in front of a car in pursuit of a cat or rabbit. A Border Terrier's more likely to die in an accident than of old age, so be prepared to protect him from himself.It's also important to prevent boredom. A bored Border _яс one who's left alone for long periods _яс becomes noisy and destructive. This is not a dog that does well left out in the yard all day. You'll likely come home to find your neighbors lined up to complain about the barking (which is meant to be heard from 10 feet underground) and your yard filled with holes indicating that your Border is well on his way to China.To keep your Border and the neighbors happy and your yard free of holes, give your Border at least half an hour per day of vigorous exercise. Besides keeping him entertained, exercise will help keep your Border trim _яс this small breed is prone to obesity.With their needs for companionship and activity met, Borders are happy dogs who generally get along well with everyone from children to strangers. They'll bark at noises, making them excellent watchdogs, but don't expect them to be fierce guard dogs if an intruder enters your home.The Border Terrier can make you laugh and cry and laugh some more.

But before you bring a Borzoi to your palace, you need to decide if a Borzoi is right for you.Prized for their grace as well as their sweet dispositions, Borzoi are known for their speed, juxtaposed with a laidback personality. They prefer a quick sprint to long-distance running and are then satisfied to return indoors to relax on a favorite sofa. They're not what you'd call a high-energy dog. If you want to spend the day in bed or on the sofa, your Borzoi will be happy to spend it there with you.Despite his relaxed attitude and regal appearance, the Borzoi is not simply a beautiful showpiece for your home. This giant breed, whose height ranges from 28 to 32 inches, has a mind of his own and a desire for human companionship. He's not the best choice for people who are away from home for long hours every day. His luxurious double coat, which kept him warm during brutal Russian winters, sheds heavily. His size is also a consideration for people with small children. The Borzoi is gentle, but puppies are enthusiastic and may accidentally knock over a toddler in play.The Borzoi's athleticism serves him well in dog sports. Naturally, he's beautiful in the show ring, and he can also compete well in agility, obedience, and rally. But where he shines is in the lure coursing field, exercising his natural instinct to chase. In Western states, Borzoi are sometimes used in open field coursing to hunt jackrabbit, and some farmers use them against coyotes to protect their livestock.No longer a royal hunting companion, today the Borzoi's most important job is that of family friend.

Because of their playful nature and boundless energy, they are sometimes called the ""Peter Pan"" of the dog breeds. Boxers aren't considered fully mature until they are three years old, meaning they have one of the longest puppyhoods in the world of dogs.The typical Boxer is intelligent, alert, and fearless, yet friendly. They're loyal to their family and love to play with them, but they're also headstrong, especially if you try to use harsh training methods with them.With minimal grooming needs and legendary patience and gentleness with children, Boxers are great family companions, as long as you provide them with the physical exercise and mental stimulation they need. If you're willing and able to provide them with adequate exercise in the form of walks or runs, they can even adapt to apartment living, so long as they are able to be close to their beloved people.Boxers originated in Germany and were brought to the U.S. after World War I. Their short, shiny coats are striking: fawn or brindle with flashy white markings. All white or mostly white Boxers are not desirable because, genetically, deafness is associated with white coloring.Many Boxers have docked tails and cropped ears. If the ears are not cropped, they will hang down. Many dog owners are opting to leave their Boxers' ears and tails un-cropped these days--a practice DogTime fully supports! Let those ears and tails go natural!Boxers are renowned for their great love of and loyalty to their families. They often are distrustful of strangers at first, but will not be aggressive unless they perceive a threat to their families. Boxers are so loving that they often think they are lapdogs and try to lie as close to you as possible.Boxer owners around the world take special delight in their beloved dogs' clownish behavior. Boxers are high-spirited, happy, and energetic. They often paw, cat-like, at their toys, food bowls, and even their owners. When they are excited, they often ""kidney bean,"" a little dance that involves twisting their bodies into a semi-circle, similar to the shape of a kidney bean, and then turning in circles. Boxers also make a unique sound, called a ""woo-woo,"" when they want something or are excited. It is not exactly a bark, but rather sounds as though they are saying ""woo-woo,"" look at me!Watching a Boxer run is a delight. They are so exuberant, happy, and graceful, it's sure to bring a smile to your face, especially if they start jumping--something they love to do, twisting, and even turning somersaults to entertain you.But life isn't all fun and games for all Boxers. Because of their strength and courage, Boxers have a wide use in the military and the police, as well as search-and-rescue work. When specifically trained for guard work, Boxers are excellent watchdogs and will restrain an intruder in the same manner as a Mastiff. Boxers also excel in obedience, agility, and schutzhund--a demanding three-phase competition event that tests the dog's tracking, obedience, and protection abilities.Boxers should not be left outdoors for extended periods of time. Their short nose doesn't cool hot air efficiently in the summer, and their short coat doesn't keep them warm in the winter. Many Boxer people joke that their Boxers' range of tolerance is between 72 and 74 degrees Fahrenheit (21-22 degrees Celsius).Boxers aren't the breed for everyone, but if you like a big dog who likes to cuddle, don't mind a little drool between friends, want a dog that will delight you with clownish antics and yet be gentle with your children, and most of all, if you are prepared to keep your Boxer physically and mentally stimulated, the Boxer just might be the right dog for you!"

These early experiences help ensure you have an adult Briard with a positive outlook on life.There are exceptions, of course, but for the most part, the Briard does extremely well with children. If you're bringing a Briard pupК__ясК_К_or any dogК__яс into a house with kids, it's important to teach both how to interact with each other. If you do not have children, but plan on doing so in the next few years, it's essential that you socialize your puppy to children."

The truth depends on your own interests and activity levels. Like all sporting breeds, the Brittany has energy to spare _яс he is certainly an Energizer Bunny of a dog _яс and that combined with his other qualities can make him a good fit for the right home.Brittanys are remarkable in many ways. Their medium size _яс 30 to 40 pounds and 17 to 20 inches tall _яс is attractive to families and sportsmen alike. They're not too big to stay in the house or travel with you in your car if you have a passion for hunting. And they're versatile. Brittanys have won more dual championships than any other breed. A dual championship means that the dog has won championships in both field trials and conformation shows.However, the Brittany isn't for everyone. For one thing, his energy level might be more than many people bargain for. Brittanys have an irrepressible joy of life and a high level of enthusiasm for everything they do, whether that's playing with the kids, seeking out birds, or simply enjoying life with a good, stretched-out, no-holds-barred run. If you don't have the same energy and enthusiasm, it can be difficult to keep up with a Brittany.Because of his extraordinary energy, it's important to provide him with plenty of exercise. A walk around the block isn't enough. If his basic need for exercise and a job to do isn't met, he may become neurotic and hyperactive, expending his energy in ways that you probably won't like.All dogs like to have ""work"" to do, but Brittanys are especially task-oriented. You can't leave your Brittany home alone all day while you go to work and then expect him to be mellow and want to lie at your feet when you come home. Not going to happen with this dog! He will have a day's worth of energy and affection pent up, and he'll be bursting at the seams to expend both. Brittanys require an hour or more of exuberant exercise every day, which makes them unsuitable for most apartment dwellers.If you're looking for a Brittany puppy, you may hear breeders differentiating between ""American"" Brittanys and ""French"" Brittanys. Both are the same breed, but the American Brittany is taller and faster than the French Brittany, which is smaller and generally works more closely to the hunter.Brittanys are known for being sensitive to harsh treatment. A stern look or a sharp word is often sufficient punishment when your Brittany is acting up. Train them firmly but gently, using positive reinforcement techniques such as praise, play, and food rewards.Because of their happy, friendly nature, Brittanys are good with children and other pets. Their exuberance, however, make cause them to accidentally injure a small child, so be sure to supervise your Brittany when it is playing with your children.If you purchase your Brittany to use for hunting, you'll find that he works much like a pointer, with a smaller range. Brittanys point on game and willingly retrieve both on land and in the water. Brittanys have a natural instinct for hunting, which makes them a good choice for people who are new to the sport of hunting.If hunting is not the sport for you, consider participating in agility, flyball, or other such activities with your Brittany. Your dog will love it, and so will you!If you can keep up with the Brittany's exercise needs and need for a job, you'll find that he's a great family companion. Brittanys are good-looking dogs who attract compliments. Their grooming needs are relatively simple. They're always happy, friendly, and affectionate. They could well be the perfect dog for families who play hard, love the outdoors, and want a dog to share it with them."

Make sure your dog gets at least one good half-hour- to hour-long walk per day with a few good, active play sessions and shorter walks mixed-in.The Broholmer has a calm and friendly demeanor and can get along with children of all ages but would be best suited with those who know how to play with them gently.These dogs are wary towards strangers but will not be aggressive.

This small, sturdy dog has an intelligent and lively look that's almost human in expression.Brussels Griffons, often called Griffons for short, originated in Belgium, where their hunting skills were used to keep stables free of rats and mice. They eventually became more popular as house pets, and these cheerful, curious, and affectionate dogs do make great companions _яс for the right person. They're sensitive, sometimes moody and high-strung, and more than a little demanding of their owner's attention.In the U.S., there are two types of Brussels Griffons: The rough-coated Griffon and the smooth-coated Griffon, called the Petit Brabancon. In the breed's homeland of Belgium, there are three types: the Petit Brabancon (which is smooth-coated, as in the U.S.), the Brussels Griffon, which has a rough red coat, and the Belgian Griffon, which has a rough coat that can be any color other than red.The Griffons' flat face, prominent chin, and large, wide-set eyes have led to many comparisons to the Ewoks or Wookie creatures in Star Wars. Despite their small size and cuddly looks, these sturdy dogs are suprisingly heavy and athletic. Many Griffons compete in agility, obedience, and other performance sports.Griffons usually get along well with other dogs and pets. They're very affectionate and tend to bond most closely with one person in the family. They especially love to snuggle with their favorite person.Because they're small and active in the house, they make good apartment dogs, although you may have to train them not to bark at every noise they hear.This unique breed isn't for everyone. The Griffon needs an owner who appreciates a dog that's up-close and personal rather than independent. Empty nesters are often ideal, because Griffons are like children who never grow up and leave for college. Of course, this trait doesn't appeal to everyone. Griffons require a time commitment, not only because they want a lot of time and attention from their people, but also because they can live to be 14 or 15 years old."
Xavier Mccullough,Dog,Bull Terrier,https://cdn1-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2011/01/file_23060_bull-terrier-460x290.jpg,Male,6,Available,"If you remember the late 1980s, you probably recall the Budweiser commercials featuring a Bull Terrier named Spuds Mackenzie, whose sly grin and on-screen antics turned the breed into a pop icon. Many people were captivated by the breed's unique head, muscular build, and fun-loving nature. After the ads aired, the Bull Terrier's popularity soared.Nicknamed ""the kid in a dog suit,"" the Bull Terrier is active and friendly, as well as being one of the clowns of the dog world. He has a larger-than-life personality that ranges from intelligent and innovative _яс not always the most desirable qualities in a dog _яс to placid and loyal. He also comes in a smaller version _яс the Miniature Bull Terrier _яс who shares the same attributes.Life with a Bull Terrier is always an experience. He's a ""busy"" dog from puppyhood well into middle age. The Bull Terrier isn't content to spend long periods alone day after day; he wants to be with his people, doing what they're doing. He does best with an active family who can provide him with plenty of energetic play. He also needs someone who will consistently (but kindly) enforce the house rules. Otherwise, he'll make up rules of his own. For that reason, he's not the best choice for timid owners or people who are new to dogs.Like most terriers, Bull Terriers (unneutered males in particular) can be aggressive toward other animals, especially other dogs. To be well-behaved around other canines, they need early socialization: positive, supervised exposure to other dogs that begins in early puppyhood and continues throughout life. Cats and other furry animals who enter their territory should beware.Because they can be rambunctious, Bull Terriers aren't recommended for homes with younger children, but with older kids they're tireless playmates. They enjoy vigorous daily exercise and can be highly destructive if they're bored. Successfully training a Bull Terrier calls for patience, confident leadership, and consistency.Some cities and states have restrictions on or ban ownership of Bull Terriers, and you should be aware of your local laws before you bring your Bull Terrier home.If you're ready to take on the challenge of a Bull Terrier, you'll find him to be an affectionate, loyal companion who's always ready to entertain you _яс he's been known to make even the most serious of people giggle _яс or go on an adventure.

Kerry Watkins,Dog,Bulldog,https://cdn1-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2011/01/file_23140_bulldog-460x290.jpg,Male,7,Available,"What do England, the U.S. Marines, Yale University, University of Georgia, and dozens of other schools all have in common? The dog they have all chosen to represent their tough, tenacious characters. That dog? Why, it's the Bulldog, of course!Sometimes called the English Bulldog or the British Bulldog, the breed originated in England and has a bloody past. It descended from fighting mastiffs that were brought to the British Isles by the Romans and was used in a bloody sport called bullbaiting. Today, however, the Bulldog only slightly resembles his ancestors in appearance. And all of the ferociousness that he exhibited in the bullbaiting pens? Gone for good. Despite his still ferocious appearance, you'd be hard-pressed to find a dog with a sweeter, more loving disposition.Bulldogs are never mistaken for other breeds of dogs. They are a medium-size dog with a thick-set, low-slung body. Their short-muzzled head is massive and square. They have broad shoulders and chests, with thick, sturdy limbs.Although Bulldogs are low to the ground, they are wide and muscular. Their broad heads have cheeks that extend to the sides of their eyes, and the skin on their foreheads should have dense wrinkles. A Bulldog has a droopy upper lip and his lower jaw is undershot, meaning that his lower teeth stick out farther than his top teeth. The Bulldog's jaws are massive and strong, intended for latching on to his opponent and holding on.Bulldogs have round, dark eyes. Their ears are small and thin, folded back like a rose. Their short tails are carried low on their rumps.The Bulldog's muscular body leads him to have a distinctive gait. Because his stocky legs are set at each corner of his body, he moves with more of a waddle than a walk. It resembles sort of a loose-jointed, shuffling, sideways roll. Because their shoulders are much wider than their rear ends and they have such large heads, it's difficult for the females to whelp puppies without assistance. Most have to have caesarean sections to deliver their puppies, so breeding a Bulldog is an expensive proposition.Despite cartoon depictions of them as ferocious dogs, today's Bulldogs are bred to be affectionate and kind. They are, indeed, resolute and courageous, but they aren't out to pick a fight. They often have a calm dignity about them when they are mature, and while they are friendly and playful, they can be a bit stubborn and protective of their families. Bulldogs love people. They seek people out for attention and enjoy nothing more than languishing next to their masters, and perhaps snoring while sleeping with their heads in their laps.Unfortunately, the Bulldog's unique body and head structure makes him prone to health problems, especially respiratory and joint difficulties. They can quickly become overweight if they don't get enough exercise. Too much weight stresses their bodies and may aggravate existing health problems.The Bulldog is popular dog in the U.S., but he's not for everyone. He's surprisingly heavy for his size, and if you need to pick him up, say to take him to the vet, it can be a challenge. Inside the house, Bulldogs tend to be inactive, preferring to sleep until it's time to eat again. They love children, but don't expect them to spend hours chasing a ball or running with the kids in the backyard. Your Bulldog may engage in such play for a while, but then you'll find him back at your side, content to watch the world go by and look up at you happily with that face that only a mother - or a devoted Bulldog fan - could love."
Angela Robles,Dog,Bullmastiff,https://cdn2-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2011/01/file_22918_bullmastiff-460x290.jpg,Male,8,Available,"In 1901, a Mr. Burton of Thorneywood Kennels challenged a group of spectators at a dog show to take on the task of escaping a muzzled dog he had brought with him, the prize being one pound--a large sum of money at the time.The volunteer was a man experienced with dogs, but he must have soon regretted his act. Despite being given a head start, he was pursued, caught, and knocked down by the dog three times.Anyone who knew the dog was a Bullmastiff wouldn't have been surprised. Developed by gamekeepers on England's great estates, the dogs served as guardians of the grounds and were bred to be courageous, confident, strong, and fast.Large and powerfully built, the Bullmastiff has a formidable appearance that's a wonderful deterrent to would-be attackers or intruders. They're a determined protector when needed and a loving family companion the rest of the time.When well-trained and well-socialized, the Bullmastiff is a confident, trustworthy, and noble credit to the breed and to dogs in general.In one sense, this is a clean breed, with a short coat that's easy to groom and doesn't shed excessively. On the other, they're droolers. With this breed it's advisable to keep a hand towel with you at all times.Despite their size, the Bullmastiff isn't a high-energy dog. A couple of short walks or playtimes a day will meet their needs. They're mellow enough to live comfortably in an apartment or condo, as long as they get their daily outings.Of course, a puppy will have more energy than an adult dog, but they should settle down by the time they're two years old. Being low-key doesn't mean they're lazy. The breed can excel in dog sports such as agility, conformation, obedience and tracking. Bullmastiffs are also super therapy dogs, thanks to their calm nature and comical expression.When it comes to training, they're an independent thinker. Guide them with firmness, fairness, and consistency from an early age, and they'll look to you as head of the household.Let them go their own way, and they'll soon be running things, so don't let that happen. Early socialization--exposure to many different people, places, sights, sounds, and experiences--is essential.With this breed's history of being a guardian dog, the Bullmastiff can do well in homes where both people work as long as he gets plenty of human interaction during at-home hours.It's okay for them to spend time in a fenced yard or kennel run, but primarily these dogs should live in the home. After all, you want a guardian dog to be Johnny-on-the-spot in the event of an intruder as well as to be emotionally close to you so he'll want to protect you. The Bullmastiff is a silent watchdog who detains unwelcome visitors with his size and presence, biting only as needed.Bullmastiffs do very well with children and show amazing patience with them. Their size can be overwhelming to toddlers, however. Nor is the Bullmastiff meant to be a baby sitter. No dog should be left unattended with young children.Bullmastiffs can reach a weight of 130 pounds, and most of that is muscle. Living with a Bullmastiff brings the responsibility of ensuring that you have a well-trained and socialized dog. When that's the case, you'll find yourself in possession of a wonderful dog who is loving, faithful, and courageous, a huggable lug who's your best friend."

The dog who played Toto in the film was a female Cairn named Terry. Paid $125 per week for her role as Toto, she was owned by trainer Carl Spitz, and she had appeared in several movies prior to her famous role in Oz. She lived to be 11 years old.The film character Toto is characteristically Cairn: a small, sturdy, shaggy-coated terrier who's highly intelligent and confident. The breed is alert and always ready for action.The Cairn is also curious and quick to learn. And, like all terriers, he's independent and a bit stubborn. He must know who is in charge, or he will take charge. Early obedience training and socialization are essential.In spite of his independent nature, the Cairn is a sensitive dog. His feelings are easily hurt, and he doesn't respond well to scolding or harsh corrections. Kind, positive training is the best method for teaching the Cairn.There is little this smart dog can't learn. With proper training, a Cairn can master an unlimited number of tricks and commands. However, it may be downright impossible to stop a Cairn from doing what Terriers love to do: chase (and dig and bark). The Cairn will chase squirrels, cats, rabbits, and other dogs if given a chance. For this reason, he should only be walked in public places on a leash, and he should be given free run only in a securely fenced yard.The Cairn actively loves kids and will patiently bear their boisterous ways. Of course, children should not be left alone with dogs of any breed, including the Cairn, and responsible adults should always supervise interactions between kids and dogs.The Cairn Terrier is a family dog, and he needs to live in the house (or apartment or condo) with his family. He thrives on attention from his loved ones, and he's unhappy if left alone too much. He can become bored at such times, which leads to destructive or annoying behaviors like barking, digging, or chewing.A Cairn Terrier is a wonderful family companion. He's fun and entertaining, loves to play with kids, and sounds the alarm when visitors approach. He is able to compete in obedience, agility, or Earthdog trials. A Cairn is a great pet for anyone who wants an independent, alert companion with a take-charge attitude toward life."
Jeffrey Ortiz,Dog,Canaan Dog,https://cdn1-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2011/01/file_23184_canaan-dog-460x290.jpg,Male,9,Available,"Dogs were an elemental part of ancient Middle Eastern communities, where they were used to herd and guard the flocks of sheep that were a man's wealth. Known as Kelef Kanani, Hebrew words meaning Canaan Dog, those primitive dogs survived for thousands of years, into the modern era, and still retain the traits that allowed them to live in harsh desert conditions. Today's Canaan Dog has the same smooth coat, prick ears, and bushy tail as his ancestors, and no doubt the same alert, watchful, inquisitive nature that made him a well-regarded herding dog. This agile dog can change directions quickly and moves at a brisk trot, covering ground more rapidly than you can imagine.Besides his pleasing form and graceful movement, the Canaan Dog is blessed with an endearing and responsive personality. Although his heritage of desert survival gives him a certain degree of independence, a Canaan Dog who's been properly socialized loves his family and is adaptable to many living situations. Life in an apartment with several short daily walks is as agreeable to him as living in a suburban home with a yard and three noisy kids. While this breed is active, its energy level isn't excessive. And the Canaan Dog's territorial nature makes him unlikely to stray far from home, although, like any dog, he should be protected from traffic and other dangers by a fenced yard.This is a versatile breed. While the Canaan Dog doesn't excel in any one area, he is smart and quick to learn, ready and willing to engage in almost any doggy activity, from tracking to herding, obedience to agility. He draws the line only at jumping into a cold lake to retrieve a bird. Today's Canaan retains primitive herding skills and some have been herding-tested with excellent results. The Canaan's herding instinct is not as powerful as that of some other breeds, notably the Border Collie, nor does he have the single-mindedness of certain sporting breeds. Few Canaans will retrieve a ball a hundred times in a row. In behavior, as in appearance, the Canaan is a moderate.Nonetheless, this is a dog who requires firm but loving handling as well as early socialization in puppyhood to counteract tendencies toward aloofness and aggression toward other dogs. Experienced dog owners will find the Canaan easy to train, but first-timers can have their hands full. A confident attitude and the help of a good trainer can ease the way. This intelligent dog responds best to motivational techniques such as food rewards, praise, and play. He's easily bored with repetitive training and requires a challenging and creative learning environment.It's also important to provide him with strong, firm leadership. A Canaan who decides he's in charge instead of you will make his own decisions about who is allowed onto his property, and this can lead to serious behavior problems.Canaan Dogs are considered highly reactive, an excellent survival trait. Reacting quickly when confronted with something new and being cautious or suspicious in new situations can save a dog's life and are among the reasons the breed survived to the present day. Canaan breeders have worked to maintain the breed's character, so these traits are still present, making them excellent watchdogs.The breed is an excellent and vocal watchdog, so be prepared for some barking. Canaans are keenly alert and will notice anything new or any new person on their property. They will bark to alert you to someone's presence but will keep their distance, circling and hanging back while watching what is going on. This causes some people to consider them shy, but it's their method of responding to new or potentially dangerous situations.Canaan Dogs get along well with children, considering them part of their pack and treating them gently. They also do well with other small pets in the household that they are raised with, including cats.The Canaan Dog has been used for centuries to herd and guard flocks and encampments, and more recently they've been used as mine detectors, trackers, and alert dogs. They compete in herding, agility, conformation, and obedience.While he's loyal and affectionate, the Canaan isn't a glutton for attention. He's capable of occupying himself as needed. This doesn't mean, of course, that he should be stuck out in the backyard all the time with no human interaction. Like any dog, Canaans are social animals who enjoy being with their people. They make wonderful companions and protectors of their family and property. If you understand and appreciate the unique qualities of this breed and are willing and able to live with a primitive breed who retains the instincts and behaviors that have kept him around for thousands of years, the Canaan Dog may be the ideal companion for you."

Smart but headstrong, the massive Caucasian Shepherd Dog needs an experienced trainer that can handle an independent attitude with firm boundaries and patience.

Caucasian Shepherd Dogs can make excellent family companions and should be indoors with their humans as much as possible.

In fact, among the characteristics that Cavalier breeders strive to attain is a tail in constant motion when this breed is moving.If the characteristic wagging of the Cavalier's plumy tail doesn't melt your heart, surely his large, dark round eyes will. Warm and lustrous, with a sweet expression, they hold the power to extract constant petting and unlimited supplies of food from people under their spell. Not surprisingly, this breed can easily become fat, which spoils its lovely lines, so be strong and offer a walk or playtime instead of the potato chips and pizza your Cavalier is angling for.Cavaliers pad through the house on slippered paws, always following in the footsteps of their people. With a Cavalier in residence, you'll never be alone _яс not even in the bathroom. Because they're so attached to their people, they do best when someone is at home during the day to keep them company. They are a housedog and will never thrive in an environment where they're relegated to the backyard or otherwise ignored.When it comes to training, Cavaliers are generally intelligent and willing to try whatever it is you'd like them to do. Food rewards and positive reinforcement help ensure that training goes smoothly. Cavaliers have a soft personality, so yelling at them is counterproductive and likely to send these sweeties into the sulks or into hiding. Instead, reward them every time you see them doing something you like, whether it's chewing on a toy instead of your Prada pumps or not barking in response when the dog next door barks. They'll fall all over themselves to find more things that you like.As with many toy breeds, Cavaliers can have issues with housetraining, but if you keep them on a consistent schedule, with plenty of opportunities to potty outdoors, they can become trustworthy in the home."

The Chesapeake Bay Retriever--nicknamed the Chessie _яс was born for these tough conditions. He's believed to be descended from two Newfoundland puppies _яс Sailor and Canton--who survived a shipwreck in the area in 1807. They were found to have fine retrieving qualities and were bred to local dogs. The result was this brown dog with a thick, water-shedding coat, a bright and happy disposition, and intelligence and courage.Given their heritage, it's not surprising that Chessies love water. When introduced to water play at a young age, they become strong, powerful swimmers, using their straight or slightly curved tail as a rudder.Chessies can fill many job descriptions. These sporting pups are prized as superb hunting dogs. They have excellent noses, and their stubborn streak _яс you knew there had to be a downside, didn't you? _яс comes in handy when they are searching for fallen game. There are authenticated stories of Chessies retrieving as many as 100 ducks in a day. With proper training, they do well as hunting companions, in hunt tests, and in the more competitive venue of field trials. Chesapeake Bay Retrievers can also do well in obedience competition if creatively trained to tolerate the repetitive nature of the sport, but rally, flyball, and agility might be better choices for them. And, of course, they're cherished companions.Chessies are friendly, outgoing, and obedient, although they can have a mind of their own. With their strength and smarts, they can easily overpower an unprepared owner, but for the experienced dog person who can give them the training structure and discipline they need, they can become a willing and hard-working companion. Daily exercise in the form of long walks or opportunities to swim will satisfy his love of activity and ensure that he's a quiet companion in the home.Like every dog, the Chessie needs early socialization _яс exposure to many different people, places, sights and sounds. Even with socialization, his temperament is such that as an adult he isn't exuberantly friendly with strangers; he tends to be reserved when meeting people for the first time. This characteristic makes him an excellent watchdog who is highly protective of his people and property. On the down side, some Chessies can be aggressive toward other dogs. In both instances, your Chessie must learn to defer to your leadership when it comes to interacting with other people and dogs.Train your Chessie with consistency and positive reinforcement _яс rewards for correct behavior. Keep training fun and avoid repetition so he doesn't become bored. Always end training sessions on a high note, praising or rewarding him for something he's done well. In other words, quit while you're both ahead! He learns best from people he knows and loves, so don't try to take the easy way out by sending him off to a trainer. This loyal dog will work best for you if you train him yourself.The Chessie often has an excellent rapport with children, but he won't tolerate abuse from them. In most situations, if he doesn't like the way he's being treated, he'll get up and leave the situation if possible. Interactions between small children and any dog should always be supervised.A healthy, temperamentally sound Chessie puppy is active and inquisitive with a glossy coat and pink gums and tongue. Puppies should already be enthusiastically retrieving objects, unperturbed by loud noises, and eager to approach people. They should never seem shy, fearful, or aggressive.With such a good start in life, plus your leadership and training, this serious, sensitive, and strong-minded dog will become a well-loved member of the family."

Wendy Luna,Dog,Chihuahua,https://cdn3-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2011/01/file_23102_chihuahua-460x290.jpg,Male,6,Available,"The Chihuahua is a saucy little hot tamale and not just because of his association with a certain fast-food Mexican restaurant. He's renowned for being the world's smallest dog, but he may well have the world's biggest personality stashed inside that tiny body. That larger-than-life persona makes him appealing to men and women alike.Fun loving and busy, Chihuahuas like nothing better than to be close to their people. They follow them everywhere in the house and ride along in tote bags when their people run errands or go shopping. It's not unusual for Chihuahuas to form a close bond with a single person, and they can become very demanding if they're overindulged.Besides being affectionate housemates, Chihuahuas are intelligent and fast learners. They can compete in agility and obedience trials with just as much enthusiasm and success as larger dogs. That said, they're willful little dogs. You'll be most successful if you can persuade them that competing _яс or simply doing as you ask _яс is fun. Use positive reinforcement in the form of praise and food rewards when training your Chihuahua. He won't respond to harsh treatment.It's important when considering the Chihuahua to take into account his small size. Chihuahuas are curious and bold explorers. They've escaped from yards through small gaps in the fence and can squeeze into places that other puppies and dogs wouldn't be able to fit. And even though they tend to rule the roost, they can be accidentally injured by rambunctious larger dogs.Chihuahuas are not recommended for homes with children under the age of eight, simply because of the chance of injury by a young child. Regardless of your family situation, it's important to remember to socialize your Chihuahua to children, adults, and other animals. Chihuahuas are mistrustful of strangers, which makes them good watchdogs, but they need to learn to meet people in a friendly manner. It's also important to remember that Chihuahuas tend to forget they are small and will stand up to a larger aggressive dog; as a result the Chihuahua needs vigilant supervision in new situations, while they're on walks, and when they're in the yard.The Chihuahua's personality and unique size make him a wonderful go-everywhere companion. People who live with Chihuahuas become devoted to them, and many say that once you share your life with one, there will be no other dog breed for you."

Stephanie Wilson,Dog,Chinese Crested,https://cdn2-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2011/01/file_23104_17524831.jpg,Female,10,Available,"The Chinese Crested is an exotic-looking small dog who does not actually hail from China. He's found in two variants: the Hairless, with silky hair on the head (the crest), tail (plume), and feet (socks); and the genetically recessive Powderpuff, who has a full coat. Both variants can be found in a single litter.Regardless of variation, the Crested is a slender, finely boned dog who is elegant and graceful. He's a beauty, although he tends to win Ugly Dog Contests more often than other competitors. He's your basic big dog in a small, sometimes naked-looking body.Dog books often describe the Chinese Crested as highly friendly, but that's actually the exception rather than the rule. Yes, he's highly likely to smile at you when he's been naughty, but that's not quite the same thing. He's likely to be extremely sensitive and reactive, and he has a high social drive, all of which makes him needy. (Expect yours to sleep under the covers with you.) He can be wonderful with familiar people, but he's likely to bite strangers unless he's been well socialized and trained to refrain from this impulse.Contrary to popular opinion, the Hairless does not need to wear sun block, moisturizing lotion, or any other substance applied to the skin at any time; often that just causes problems. The skin has a better chance of staying healthy if nothing is put on it. Cresteds do need to be bathed regularly, however, every one or two weeks.Many of the Hairless types actually have a lot of body hair. Unsurprisingly, most people aren't prepared for how hairy a Hairless can be, and it can be an issue for allergy sufferers. These dogs aren't hypoallergenic; they're just low shedders compared to other breeds _яс but still, they shed more than you'd think a ""hairless"" dog would. And even the Hairless has noticeable hair on his head, legs, and tail. Some allergic people are fine with the Hairless variety, while others have no tolerance.This body hair must be kept shaved to keep the skin healthy. Letting it grow out is often excused as a way to keep the dog warm, but the long coat doesn't perform this function and instead triggers skin problems (sweaters are a better option for warmth). The Crested doesn't sweat through his skin, and he has the same body temperature as any other breed. Some are prone to a canine equivalent of acne, however.The Hairless Crested is incredibly, unbelievably tolerant of heat. He can lie in 100-degree sun for hours, like a lounge lizard, with no problems. He rarely pants and drinks very little water, which is pretty disconcerting for experienced dog owners who leave lots of water out.Conversely, he has absolutely no tolerance for cold. Some people try to ""harden"" their Crested by exposing him to cold, as though he were a seedling. This is not only cruel, it doesn't work. Cold will kill this dog a lot faster than heat will.Take a cautious approach to vaccinations, cortisone drugs, and topical applications with this dog. Rabies shots often trigger reactions. Some Cresteds can have a terrible reaction to medications, including topical flea preventives. A conservative approach to drug therapy is safest, so don't use anything that is not actually necessary. Normally, they don't need any flea or tick preventives _яс they are a last resort for fleas.Cresteds are wonderful family dogs who love to be with the people in their lives. They do well with children, although you should consider the age of the children and how they interact with dogs before bringing this small creature into your heart and home. They can be hurt easily and shouldn't be left unsupervised with children, or even alone out in the yard. With family members of any age who know how to handle dogs, however, they'll play games, affectionately cuddle up on the couch, and enjoy an active life.Because they're so social and needy, Cresteds can suffer from separation anxiety, which can lead to barking and destructive habits. They'll climb and dig to escape confinement if left on their own for too long. When you're around, they're comparatively quiet dogs, but they will alarm bark.They do well in apartments and any other type of dwelling. The Chinese Crested is a wonderful family dog who is playful, affectionate, and endearing. He's a stable companion who fills his owners' lives with love, laughter, and entertainment.Chinese Cresteds are adept at jumping, digging, and climbing. Don't make the common mistake of underestimating their athletic abilities just because they're small. They are Houdini Hounds who can escape from virtually any enclosure. A six-foot fence around the yard is a good idea; if they can get a grip on a fence, they're over it. They have absolutely no fear of climbing or jumping, and they can clear four feet from a standing position.Once they're out, they move fast and are _яс how shall we say this _яс averse to recapture. They are more stubborn than you are. Their athletic abilities are why many Chinese Cresteds are taking the conformation, obedience, and agility worlds by storm.Chinese traders once used the Chinese Crested as ratters on their ships, and they may have served this function in agricultural settings as well. Today they enjoy life as beloved family pets, but they also have the personality to excel at being more than just pampered pooches."

But that's not the only thing unusual about the Chinese Shar-Pei. He's a solid mass of loose wrinkles _яс folds of skin that make him look like he's wearing a bulky, oversized suit. His tiny ears sit atop a large, powerful head with a short muzzle and purple tongue. The finishing touch is a thick, round tail that curls over his back.To be sure, the Shar-Pei is an interesting-looking dog, and his looks alone are enough to prompt many would-be owners to choose this breed. But there's more to the Shar-Pei than his unique appearance.This breed is calm enough that he can live in an apartment. He's also an independent-thinking, sometimes aloof dog. His heritage as a guardian and fighting dog make him an excellent watchdog and guard dog _яс so much so that he must be taught not to overreact to people and animals he doesn't know.Early training is essential for the strong-willed Shar-Pei. He needs an owner who is able to establish leadership firmly and kindly, and he tends not to respect the owner who doesn't do so. He's a quick study, so training is generally easy as long as he's not showing his stubborn streak.Grooming is a cinch with the Shar-Pei. He's a naturally clean dog and frequent bathing isn't necessary or recommended. With all those wrinkles, however, he can be prone to skin problems so extra attention and care may be needed in that area.The Shar-Pei isn't as popular as he used to be, which is actually good for the breed. Increased popularity leads to increased breeding, especially by unscrupulous breeders who breed with no regard for health, temperament, and conformation. Unfortunately, that's what happened to the Shar-Pei in the 1980s. Responsible breeders have been working to regain the breeds' loyal, loving temperament, and to diminish or eliminate health problems."

The litter of tawny puppies, born on January 17, 1917, included a male who grew up to be big-boned, flop-eared, and handsome, with a gentle nature. He was named Chinook, and he fathered puppies who bore his stamp.Since then, the breed that bears his name has had its ups and downs. It has come close to disappearing several times, but someone has always stepped in to rescue it from the brink of extinction.That's not surprising when you consider that inside the Chinook's plain brown wrapper is heart, strength, intelligence, and a mellow sweetness.The Chinook was bred for his pulling ability and stamina. Today, his expedition days are behind him and he's considered the consummate companion: loving, athletic, and versatile. He's a great choice if you want a jogging or hiking companion; not so much if you're looking for a retriever or water dog.And look elsewhere if you want a guard or watchdog. Still, even though he's not aggressive, his size may be enough to ward off anyone scary.Chinooks are easy to groom, but they shed heavily twice a year, with light to moderate shedding the rest of the time. Avoid them if you're looking for a dog that might be hypoallergenic. The Chinook is not it.True to their sled dog heritage, some Chinooks can be diggers, excavating a nice spot where they can nap. This is an inborn behavior, so be prepared for your yard to have a cratered appearance. Try getting around it by giving a Chinook his own special place to dig.A Chinook's vocabulary ranges from silence to woo-woos to excited whining. You may get a quiet one, but more often than not your Chinook will happily share his opinion with you about the day's goings-on.The Chinook is a rare breed, and you won't find one just anywhere. Expect to wait as long as six months to two years before a puppy is available, especially if you have your heart set on a particular sex or ear type (floppy or prick ear). Prices generally range from $650 to $1,500."

His looks might make you think he's mean or ill-tempered, but a well-bred and well-raised Chow isn't aggressive.Instead, it's said that the Chow combines the nobility of a lion, the drollness of a panda, the appeal of a teddybear, the grace and independence of a cat, and the loyalty and devotion of a dog. He's also dignified and aloof, as befits a breed that was once kept in imperial Chinese kennels.He's not really fond of being hugged or fussed over, but he'll be a quiet, attentive companion to his favorite person, and his loyalty extends to other family members. If he's raised with children, he'll accept them willingly, but he's not the type of dog to tolerate abuse, so he's best for homes with older kids who know how to treat dogs.If he has lots of positive encounters with strangers during his impressionable puppyhood, he'll handle strangers with equanimity. This is, however, a highly territorial and protective breed, who'll give a clear warning to anyone approaching without his person's welcome.The breed's most memorable physical feature may be his blue-black tongue. According to Chinese legend, the tongue got its blue hue at the time of creation, when a Chow licked up drops of the color as the sky was being painted. He also stands out for his almost straight rear legs, which give him a stiff, choppy, or stilted gait. He's not speedy, so he's not the best choice for a jogger, but he has excellent endurance and can be a good walking companion.When it comes to training, a verbal correction is usually all that's required to set the Chow Chow straight. No dog should ever be hit, but it's especially counterproductive with this breed. The fiercely proud and independent Chow will never respond to physical abuse. But earn his respect with firm consistency, and you won't have any problem training him.If you admire the Chow Chow's unique appearance and independent spirit, you'll have a fiercely loyal companion who will be a true treasure in your household."

Sometimes their coats are solid, and sometimes they have a mix of colors.Their fluffy, long, double-coats make the Chusky a heavy shedder. They may not be the best dog for allergy sufferers. Daily brushing will help cut down on excessive shedding. Their coats are suited for cold weather, but they may not do as well in hotter climates.When it comes to other pets, Chuskies can get along with other animals if they are introduced slowly and calmly, and early socialization will help this go smoothly. That said, they may prefer to be the solo pet in the home.Chuskies are intelligent, but they can be stubborn. They thrive best with experienced dog owners.This mixed breed is known to be protective, especially of family. Your Chusky may bark every time someone knocks at the door or someone new enters the home. This also makes them excellent guard dogs."
Casey Wood,Dog,Clumber Spaniel,https://cdn1-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2011/01/file_22960_clumber-spaniel-460x290.jpg,Female,5,Available,"With his large head, low body, and substantial build, the Clumber Spaniel is often described as a dog who plods along with no great speed, agility, or energy, but that description doesn't do him justice. It's true that he's a slow worker, but he has power and endurance, as well as great enthusiasm.He comes alive when he hits bird scent and is painstakingly thorough in exploring it until he either finds his prey or decides to move on. He's a perfect choice for the hunter who wants to enjoy his sport at a relaxed pace with a dog who will stay close at hand.The Clumber works at a trot and is capable of going all day long at this pace. He wasn't bred to be a water retriever, but most Clumbers swim well and their heavy coat protects them from cold water. Those used as duck dogs don't have any problem breaking ice to retrieve their game.This medium-size dog is the heaviest of the spaniel breeds with a long body that helps him move through underbrush. (That long body also gives him a surprisingly far reach when it comes to food on kitchen counters.) He's characterized by a massive head, dark amber eyes, and a medium-length white coat with lemon or orange markings.Calm and sedate, the Clumber is a sweet and gentle dog who enjoys the company of his people. He bonds to the entire family but sometimes chooses one person as his special favorite. Nicknamed the ""retired gentleman's spaniel,"" he's a good choice for first-time dog owners because of his easygoing temperament.The Clumber will adjust his activity level to your needs. His sporting heritage means he enjoys a good walk and can excel in the field or at a variety of dog sports, but he's also quite fond of hearth and home, especially if he can nap on top of your feet.The Clumber is playful and intelligent, mischievous and stubborn, dignified and charming. A whole host of such adjectives have been applied to this breed, but suffice it to say that he's a much-loved member of the family who thrives on attention. Children who play ball with him will find him to be a tireless friend.He's happy to occupy himself by carrying things around in his mouth, a habit he begins in earliest puppyhood and continues throughout his days. It's not unusual to see him wriggle his whole body as he greets someone, all the while with a favorite toy or other object in his mouth.The Clumber is not an easy-care dog, but neither does he require the same devotion to grooming as, say, a Poodle or Afghan Hound. He does shed, sometimes heavily, and needs daily brushing if you want to keep loose hair off your clothes and furniture. Nor is he recommended for the neat at heart. Clumber Spaniels shed, slobber, and track dirt into the house. If any type of mess bothers you, choose a different breed.Clumber Spaniels need daily exercise, which can be satisfied by one 20- or 30-minute walk or a 15- or 20-minute walk or playtime twice a day. While Clumbers make excellent walking companions, they're not suited to accompanying joggers. The breed has a high incidence of hip dysplasia, and jogging can put unnecessary strain on their joints.Training is fairly easy with this intelligent breed, although there are exceptions to every rule. In general, however, Clumbers respond well to praise and positive reinforcement in the form of food rewards or play. Their gentle dispositions can be easily damaged if they are corrected harshly. Instead, be fair and consistent in what you ask, and reward him every time you see him doing something you like.People who love Clumbers say that once you have one, you'll never want to be without one. Whether he's your hunting buddy or a family friend, the Clumber will return your affection and loyalty many times over _яс and will warm your feet as part of the bargain."

Brian Graham,Dog,Cockapoo,https://cdn2-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2011/01/file_23218_cockapoo-dog-breed.jpg,Male,8,Available,"The Cockapoo blazed the trail among planned hybrids; he's the offspring of the Poodle and the Cocker Spaniel. Also known as the Cockapoodle, Cockerpoo, or Cock-a-Poo, he's an utterly adorable little dog with a face that could melt a heart of stone.He's affectionate and accepts everyone _яс old folks, kids, and other pets. He's also of an easy size, being small enough to cuddle and big enough to romp with bigger dogs. Cockapoos have an infectious zest for life that spreads to everyone around them, that essential joie de vivre that makes every day a celebration. These guys are just plain happy to be alive.Still, what's the draw in getting a Cockapoo instead of a Cocker Spaniel or a Poodle? It's that, in some ways, the Cockapoo represents two ideals: first, what the Cocker Spaniel used to be across the board _яс a sweet and stable temperament, before the breed's popularity skyrocketed in the wake of Lady and the Tramp; and second, the Poodle's orientation to people smooths out the Cockers' orientation to their noses when they're out in the field.Furthermore, Cockapoos don't require the level of grooming that Poodles do, and people don't automatically react as negatively as they do to a Poodle's extravagant grooming style for showing in conformation. (While it's not fair to dislike the intelligent and jovial Poodle because of a show cut, the Poodle's mostly undeserved reputation of high maintenance is pervasive.)Of course, there's a world of difference between an intentional breeding of carefully selected Cocker Spaniels and Poodles versus a Poodle mix who's just called a Cockapoo because no one has any clue what his background really is.The true Cockapoo been bred with the goal of a healthy, hypoallergenic dog with a good temperament. Cockapoo breeders feel that the dog's health and temperament are far more important than appearance, and that's what they continue to strive for (but nevertheless, the Cockapoo tends to be an adorable-looking fellow). You won't find many, if any, discussions among these breeders about head shape and height.When the cross works as intended, you get the intelligence and spirit of the Poodle with the sturdiness and field spirit of the Cocker. Of course, when the cross doesn't work, you can get a submissive, urinating fear-biter _яс but that can happen in any mixed breed, and in any purebred with unhappy genes.Generally, the Cocker Spaniel used to create the Cockapoo is an American Cocker Spaniel, but some are the offspring of Poodles and English Cocker Spaniels; the latter is often called a Spoodle. Efforts have been made over the last decade to clearly separate Cockapoos and Spoodles into two different hybrids, and some success has been achieved. If the type of Cocker involved is important to you, be sure to ask.But all that is neither here nor there for the Cockapoo enthusiast, who just wants to hang out with a sweet, cute, attached dog who isn't quite the barnacle a Toy Poodle can be, and who began as a sparkle in the eye of a Cocker Spaniel with a lovely, even temperament."
Janet Smith,Dog,Cocker Spaniel,https://cdn1-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2011/01/file_22962_cocker-spaniel-460x290.jpg,Male,6,Available,"The smallest member of the American Kennel Club Sporting Group, the Cocker Spaniel is the darling of many U.S. pet owners. Remember the female lead in Lady and the Tramp? It's no accident that the movie's model of an affectionate and pampered pet was a Cocker Spaniel. From the late 1930s to the 1950s, the Cocker was the number-one breed registered with the AKC. Then his popularity declined for almost 30 years, but he shot to the top of the charts again during the mid-1980s, and only in 1992 was his number-one status taken over by Labrador and Golden Retrievers. Today, the Cocker remains within the top 15 registered breeds.And no wonder _яс a well-bred Cocker Spaniel is a pleasure to own. He is known for a merry, sound temperament. His flowing coat is extremely handsome, he's loving and gentle, and he wants nothing more than to make his family happy.Compared to other dogs in the Sporting Group, the Cocker is small (20 to 30 pounds), fitting comfortably into an apartment, condo, or a small home. He is primarily a companion but is easily trained for the conformation show ring, obedience and agility competitions, and field work. He is also an excellent therapy dog.The Cocker Spaniel resembles the English Cocker Spaniel, one of his peers in Sporting Group, and formerly the two breeds were considered one. However, a number of Spaniel fanciers noticed the different strains of Cocker and sought to preserve separate breeds and discourage the interbreeding of the English and American varieties. The American Kennel Club recognized the two breeds as separate in 1946.The typical Cocker Spaniel is gentle, a loving and trustworthy family companion who is good with children, other pets, and the elderly. Unfortunately, his extreme popularity leaves him open to the bane of all favorite breeds: unscrupulous people who breed with no regard for temperament, health, or conformation.As a result, some Cocker Spaniels have serious health and temperament problems. If you are considering a Cocker Spaniel, you must be extremely careful from whom you buy or adopt a puppy. Buy only from a reputable breeder. Never buy a puppy from a backyard breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Reputable breeders breed with temperament in mind and perform various health tests to ensure that their breeding dogs don't pass on a predisposition to genetic diseases."

After all, the star of this long-running show wasn't just any dog. She was Lassie, a Collie dog.To be sure, the adventures of Timmy and Lassie are fun to watch. But they're fiction _яс aren't they?Well, according to those who know and love the Collie breed, the fictional accounts of television Lassie aren't too far off the mark. The real-life Collie is an extremely intelligent, sensitive dog who is known for her uncanny ability to know when something is wrong. True stories abound about this breed coming to the rescue of people and animals.Heroics aside, the Collie is a medium-size (50 to 70 pounds) dog, easy to train, devoted to and protective of her family, and friendly with people outside the family circle as well. Known for being playful and gentle, she makes an excellent companion for children.Although the Collie is good-natured and friendly, she can be suspicious of strangers, especially if they approach the children in her family. She's a good watchdog _яс she will bark _яс but she is not aggressive.The beautiful Collie has two distinct looks: full coat (known as the Rough variety) and short coat (known as the Smooth variety). The television star was a Rough Collie, as was the star of the 1943 movie Lassie Come Home, which inspired the television series.Today, the Collie is more likely to be a pampered pet than an all-around farm dog. She adapts well to a variety of home environments, as long as she has plenty of daily exercise. She enjoys relaxing around the house with her family, as well as running and playing outside with the kids. Her herding instincts are still strong, so it's not unusual for the Collie to gather children and pets, chase cars, and bark.In addition to her herding ability, the loyal Collie excels as an assistance or therapy dog. She also does well at such canine sports as herding trials, agility, obedience, and lure coursing.The movie and the television series made the Collie a popular dog in the United States. Unfortunately, her extreme popularity leaves her open to the bane of all favorite breeds: unscrupulous people who breed with no regard for temperament, health, or conformation.As a result, some Collies have serious health and temperament problems.

He cocks his head intently when spoken to and will even try to answer back.The Coton de Tulear takes his name not only from his cottonlike coat but also from the seaport city of Tulear (now known as Toliara), located on the African island nation of Madagascar, where the breed originated. He's related to the Bichon Frise and Maltese but has his own distinct style.People who love the Coton praise his intelligence, sociability, and easy-care coat. He's an observant dog who quickly learns routines and adapts to his person's needs. He sleeps while you're busy, one eye cracked so he can follow if you leave the room. He's known as a good and flexible traveler, perhaps a remnant of his seafaring days, when he accompanied ladies making long journeys by ship.When it's playtime, the Coton will grab his favorite toy and bring it to you for a rousing game of fetch. He loves to go on walks, but his exercise needs aren't excessive. Playing inside or in a fenced yard will just as easily satisfy his need for activity, as long as he has plenty of human companionship. Because of his desire to please, he excels in activities such as obedience and agility.The well-socialized Coton loves everyone. When your doorbell rings, the Coton may bark once, then politely accompany you to the door to greet your guest. The only risk a housebreaker faces is being licked to death.He likes to ""talk"" to his people, using his own special language of unique vocalizations, including grunts and growls. He'll love it when you talk back to him.His soft, shaggy white coat may look difficult to care for, but once the adult coat has grown in, dirt falls out easily with brushing. Brushing three or four times weekly, plus bathing as needed, will keep your Coton clean.The Coton aims to please, and whatever makes you happy makes him happy _яс as long as it doesn't involve being apart from you.

They might be surprised to learn that he is the oldest recognized retriever around.The Curly-Coated Retriever is a large dog with an even larger heart. One glimpse of this breed in action tells you that he's an ideal hunting dog, filled with the drive and determination that all retrievers possess. His unusual coat _яс a dense mass of small, tight, crisp black or dark reddish-brown curls _яс is often mistakenly believed to be difficult to care for, but it's actually fairly easy, requiring only moderate grooming.In addition to his hunting ability, this active, intelligent dog is a wonderful jogging companion and family friend. An active family, that is. With his retriever drive, he needs daily exercise and mental stimulation in the form of training and play to keep from becoming bored and destructive.The Curly, as he's known, is loyal to his family and displays the even temper that is so well loved in all retriever breeds. He's more reserved with strangers than other retrievers, however, and needs to be properly socialized _яс exposed to many different people, sights, sounds and experiences _яс to prevent timidity.They do very well with children as long as you lay down some ground rules for dog and child. No ear pulling, tail pulling or biting allowed! For the safety of both, never leave small children unsupervised with any dog.Curly-Coated Retrievers take longer to mature than other breeds, so be prepared to live with a full-grown dog who acts like a puppy for several years. Because they're high-energy dogs, they're not suited to apartment life and should live in a home with a large fenced yard where they have plenty of room to romp.Like all retrievers, Curlies are mouthy and love to chew, nip, and carry objects. Be prepared for this trait, and work with it by providing your Curly with toys he's allowed to chew, praising him when you see him chewing them, and keeping forbidden items out of reach. Be consistent. If he's not allowed to chew on your good shoes, don't give him an old one to play with. He doesn't know the difference between Payless and Prada.For the active individual or family who would like a retriever who stands out from the crowd, the Curly-Coated Retriever is an excellent choice, as he enjoys hunting, fishing and camping in the great outdoors followed by quiet indoor evenings relaxing with his people."

Thomas Holmes,Dog,Dachshund,https://cdn3-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2011/01/file_23020_dachshund-dog-breed-460x290.jpg,Male,2,Available,"Don't let the Dachshund fool you. He might be, as legendary literary critic and humorous journalist H. L. Mencken said, ""half a dog high and a dog and a half long,"" but this small, drop-eared dog is tough enough to take on a badger. In fact, that's what he was bred to do and how he got his name (Dachs meaning badger; hund meaning dog).Dachshunds (pronounced DAKS hundК_ _ясК_ never dash-hound) come in three varieties: smooth (shorthaired), wirehaired and longhaired. In the United States, Dachshunds are either miniature (11 pounds and under as an adult) or standard (usually between 16 and 32 pounds as an adult). If your Dachshund weighs between 11 and 16 pounds, he's called a tweenie. Other countries have a wider variance in the sizes. For example, in Germany, the official birthplace of the Dachshund breed, Dachshunds are identified as Standard, Miniature, or Kaninchenteckel, based on a chest measurement taken at the age of fifteen months.No matter what their size, Dachshunds are a delightful addition to any family, which is why they have ranked near the top of most popular dogs lists since the 1950s. Their cute appearance and lively disposition have inspired many affectionate nicknames for the breed, including wiener dog, hot dog, sausage dog, Doxie, Dashie, and (especially in Germany) Teckels, Dachels, or DachselsYou can't help but smile when you look at a confident Dachshund, proudly carrying his long, muscular body on short legs, his elongated head held high with a bold, intelligent look in his eyes. Because of their almost comical appearance, Dachshunds have long been a favorite subject of cartoonists and toy makers. But their cute appearance was developed for far more serious and practical reasons. Their short legs enable them to dig and maneuver through tunnels to corner and even fight badgers and other animals, while their large chests give them plenty of ""heart"" for the fight. Dachshunds are brave, but they can be somewhat stubborn, and have an independent spirit, especially when hunting.At home, the Dachshund's playful nature comes out. He loves to be close to you and ""help"" you do things like tie your shoes. Because of his intelligence, he often has his own ideas about what the rules are when it comes to playtime-and those rules may not be the same as yours or even other breeds of dogs. Dachshunds are known for being lively and enjoy chasing other small animals, birds, and toys. The breed standard _яс a written description of how the Dachshund should look and act _яс probably describes their personality best, saying ""the Dachshund is clever, lively, and courageous to the point of rashness, persevering in above and below ground work, with all the senses well-developed. Any display of shyness is a serious fault.""Dachshunds have soulful eyes and complex facial expressions. Their lungs are large for a dog this size and they have a barrel-like chest. Because of these things, Dachshunds have a loud, deep bark that sounds as though it comes from a much larger dog. And they do like to bark, which is something you might consider if you have neighbors who could be annoyed rather than amused by the antics of your brave little Dachshund.Dachshunds often bond closely with a single person. They may even become jealous of their owner's attention and can, if not properly trained and socialized, become snappy.Smooth Dachshunds are the most popular variety in the United States. Their coats are short and shiny and need little grooming. They do, however, need a sweater in the winter if you live in an area with cold weather. Common colors are red, cream, black and tan, black and cream, chocolate and tan, blue and tan, and Isabella (fawn) and tan. Dachshunds also can have patterns in their coats, such as dapple (a mottled coat pattern), brindle, sable, and piebald.Longhaired Dachshunds have sleek, slightly wavy hair and can be the same colors as the Smooth Dachshund. They should be brushed every day to prevent mats from forming, especially around their elbows and ears. Many believe that the Longhaired Dachshund has a more docile temperament than the Smooth or Wirehair.Wirehaired Dachshunds have wiry, short, thick, rough coats with bushy eyebrows and a beard. Like Smooth Dachshunds, they often are mischievous. They won't need a sweater in the winter, but they do need to be brushed regularly to prevent mats from forming. Their coat colors can be the same as the Smooth Dachshund, but the most popular colors in the United States are wild boar (a mixture of black, brown, and gray), black and tan, and various shades of red.Dachshunds often have been seen as a symbol of Germany. Because of this association, Dachshunds lost popularity in the United States during World War I and World War II. Their appeal was too great for this to resist, however, and they quickly made a comeback in popularity. Because of the association with Germany, a Dachshund named Waldi was chosen to be the first official mascot for the 1972 Summer Olympics.Dachshunds are a good choice for apartment dwellers and people who don't have a backyard. They are popular with urban dwellers because of their small size and ease of care. They generally are active indoors and also enjoy going on walks. Just be careful not to let them get too fat or allow them to injure their backs by jumping off furniture. Also, be sure to support their backs when you are holding them. Because of their long backs, they are susceptible to slipped or ruptured (herniated) disks in their backs, which can result in partial or full paralysis.Although they originally were bred to hunt ferocious badgers and other animals, today's Dachshunds are ideal family companions. Additionally, many people show them in conformation, obedience, agility, field trials, and earthdog trials. They are also hard-working and well-appreciated therapy dogs. Some people enter their Dachshunds in Dachshund races, such as the Wiener Nationals. Although these races are popular, the Dachshund Club of America opposes ""wiener racing"" because many Greyhound tracks use the events to draw large crowds and because the DCA worries that such races could injure Dachshunds' backs.Because they are such a popular breed, many people breed Dachshunds to make money rather than out of a love for the breed and a desire to breed healthy, even-tempered dogs. Be careful to obtain your Dachshund from a reputable breeder who screens his or her breeding animals for both temperament and health problems.The Dachshund is a versatile companion. With his variety of sizes, colors, coat types, and personalities, there's a Dachshund to suit almost anyone."
Jeremy Sims DDS,Dog,Dalmatian,https://cdn3-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2011/01/file_23146_dalmatian-460x290.jpg,Male,3,Available,"With his regal carriage and unique spots, the Dalmatian is probably one of the most recognized breeds on the planet. Many people are attracted to his dashing good looks, but he's definitely not for everyone. While Dalmatians love to be with their people for any activity that occurs in the course of a day and can make wonderful companion dogs, their high energy level can be exhausting to live with.Dalmations were created to run for miles alongside carriages, helping to ward off highwaymen and add a touch of flair to the vehicle with aristocratic passengers. (Now we just have cars with racing stripes.) Not surprisingly, the Dalmatian today has an endless capacity for exercise and is the ideal companion for people who jog, skate, or bicycle. He's also a keen competitor in canine sports such as agility and flyball. A Dalmatian must have adequate daily exercise to prevent behavior problems from developing.If you are considering a Dalmatian, be aware that the breed is not only highly active but also highly intelligent. They need training early in life to establish rules for behavior, or they will decide it is their job to run things. Dalmatians can be a bit headstrong so training must be firm and consistent.At the same time Dalmatians are sensitive and do not respond well to harsh training methods. You need a positive approach to training with lots of rewards for proper behavior if you want a well-trained dog. Dalmatians are said to not forget mistreatment or harsh behavior.Another consideration should be the incidence of deafness in the breed. This condition is prevalent in Dalmatians. It is inherited as a polygenic trait, and all Dalmatian bloodlines can pass along deafness to their offspring. Approximately eight percent of Dalmatians are born completely deaf, and 22 to 24 percent are born with hearing in one ear only.The Dalmatian Club of America recommends euthanasia for all puppies found to be completely deaf. That's because they are more challenging to train and may bite if startled. Nonetheless, some people believe deaf dogs can make just as wonderful pets as hearing dogs if they are trained with hand signals and vibrations so they are less likely to be startled.If you are considering adopting a deaf puppy or older adult dog, be sure to research the issue and the special care requirements of living with a deaf dog before you suffer the heartbreak of taking the dog in and not being able to manage his care properly.Dalmatians have a urinary system unique in the dog world, and they have a few special requirements because of this to prevent medical complications. Their diet should never be extremely high in protein, and they must be allowed access to plenty of fresh water at all times. Dalmatians also should have the opportunity to relieve themselves frequently to keep the urinary system flushed. With these simple protocols in place, your Dalmatian should live a long, healthy life.Dalmatians will get along with other pets and children if socialized as a puppy with all types of pets and people. Dalmatians can make a wonderful active playmate for children (with proper supervision to be sure that both the child and the dog are following acceptable rules for behavior).With the Dalmatian's energy and enthusiasm for games, the dog and child will have a marvelous time tiring each other out. Children younger than 6 years of age may be easily knocked down by this muscular, active, and strong dog. Take special precautions and supervise interactions between smaller children and Dalmatians.You can participate in numerous dog sports and activities with your Dalmatian. He'll do well in obedience competition with the proper motivational, positive training. He's also an excellent agility competitor as the sport is tailored to athletic dogs such as the Dalmatian.Dalmatians make great hiking companions and backpacking dogs, and the sports of flyball and Frisbee are excellent activities for the well-trained Dalmatian. If your dog has the right combination of looks and personality, you may also enjoy the sport of showing dogs, known as conformation, at AKC shows.The Dalmatian Club of America sponsors a program that offers titles in keeping with the breed's history as carriage dogs. The Road Dog (RD) title and Road Dog Excellent (RDX) are titles earned by the dog accompanying horses or carriages for a certain number of miles and then performing some basic obedience. These trials are usually held in conjunction with the larger specialty shows and with the national show sponsored by the Dalmatian Club of America.Whatever you do with your Dalmatian, whether he is your best friend, active family companion, or seasoned competitor, be sure that with the right combination of exercise, discipline, and love he will be a great addition to your family."

This low-to-the-ground dog, with a body that is longer than he is tall and a distinctive ""poof"" of hair on his head, had been bred for many years before he gained fame and a name in Sir Walter Scott's book Guy Mannering, published in 1814.In that book, a farmer is portrayed as having six small, long terriers _яс three with a salt-and-pepper coloring and three with a ""mustard"" tone to their coats. The farmer's name was Dandie Dinmont and so the little dogs came to be known as Dandie Dinmont's terriers, with the apostrophe ""s"" being dropped as time went by.Even the color designations of the breed came from this fictional farmer. He had only two names for his small dogs: Pepper and Mustard. He differentiated them by calling them Auld Pepper, Auld Mustard, Young Pepper, Young Mustard, Little Pepper and Little Mustard. To this day the two colors of the breed are still known as Pepper (bluish black) and Mustard (shades of golden brown).In his book, Scott, who owned some Dandies of his own, described the little dogs as follows: ""He evolved from the Scottish Hillside, the grey mists forming his body, a bunch of lichen his topknot, crooked juniper stems his forelegs and a wet bramble his nose.""Dandie Dinmonts are unusual looking dogs that unfortunately are becoming rare. They have large, domed heads, with large, dark eyes that are set low in the front of the head. Their long ears are set low on the skull and fringed at their tips. Dandies have large chests and long backs.Unlike most terriers, Dandies have many curves in their shape. The back arches over the loin (the back end) and drops slightly to the base of the tail, which itself curves like a scimitar. Their front legs are short and powerful with paws that turn slightly outward for digging. The hind legs are slightly longer than the front legs, and not as heavy. They typically are 8 to 11 inches tall and weigh 18 to 24 pounds.Dandies are affectionate, lively dogs. Like many terriers, they also are independent and determined. They are very intelligent and typically are bold in defending their territory and family, but reserved with strangers, at least initially. Many describe them as being dignified, and even 100 years ago, they were described as having ""melancholy eyes as of a nobleman in disguise.""Dandies typically get along well with children and other pets, so long as they are brought up with them or exposed to them in puppyhood.Although their exercise needs are not great, you should always keep them on a leash in unfenced areas, as their instincts to chase game might kick in at an unexpected moment.Training your Dandie will take a bit of patience. They seem to get bored with repetitive tasks. Make training fun for your Dandie, and you'll be amazed at how quickly he learns and how clever he truly is."

This hasn't stopped the Dobie, as he is affectionately called, from becoming one of the most popular and recognized breeds in the United States.His look is elegant and his style is athletic; the Dobie is also intelligent, alert, and loyal. He is a courageous guard dog as well as a beloved family companion.The Dobie's fierce reputation precedes him. He is feared by those who don't know him, stereotyped as highly aggressive and vicious. True, he is a formidable guardian, but he is usually a gentle, watchful, and loving dog. He does not go looking for trouble, but he is fearless and will defend his family and turf if he perceives danger.The Doberman Pinscher enjoys being part of a family. He likes to be close to those he loves and, when this love is present, he is a natural protector. He is trustworthy with his family's children, friends, and guests as long as he is treated kindly.In spite of his positive qualities, the Dobie isn't the right breed for everyone. He's large, at 60 to 80 pounds, and he's extremely active, both physically and mentally. He needs a lot of exercise.He also needs plenty of mental challenges to keep him from becoming bored. He needs a strong owner/pack leader who can take time to properly socialize and train him, and who will keep him busy every day. This may be too much to handle for people who lead a more laid-back lifestyle.The current look of the Dobie is slimmer and sleeker than that of past years. His temperament has also changed somewhat, say breed enthusiasts, softening a bit from his early days in Germany, though he is still an excellent guard dog.Originally, Dobies' ears were cropped to increase their ability to locate sounds, and tail docking gave the breed a more streamlined look. North American breeders usually dock the tails and crop the ears of Doberman puppies, though it's not mandatory. Docking and ear cropping is illegal in some countries.Those who know him say that a well-bred and properly socialized Dobie is an excellent pet and companion, suitable for families with other dogs, gentle with young children, and overall a loyal and devoted family member."

Despite its capability for aggression when it comes to hunting, the Dogo Argentino generally has a happy disposition, and it is fiercely loyal to its human family. This breed's strength requires a firm, active trainer who is capable of keeping big dogs in line, and they need strict boundaries. A tall, strong fence for the yard is a must, or else the Dogo Argentino's prey drive can lead them to chase small animals or wander. Socialization with other humans and pets is also key to keeping the Dogo Argentino's natural caution around strangers and other animals in check. Dogo Argentinos need to stay active, or they may become bored and prone to destructive behavior. They should not be left alone for long periods of time.

Not very long ago, American and English Cockers were considered to be the same breed. The decision to classify them as separate breeds was made in the 1930s when it became evident that Cocker Spaniels in the U.S. were different than ones in England.One difference is size. The English Cocker Spaniel is larger than the American Cocker Spaniel. They also have different body types. And unlike the American Cocker, the English Cocker is likely to be found in the field alongside his cousins the Field Spaniel and the English and Welsh Springer Spaniels.The engaging English Cocker is happy and affectionate. He's a sturdy dog with a long, square muzzle, expressive eyes, long ears that reach the tip of his nose when pulled forward, and a docked tail. The English Cocker has a medium-length coat, although the English Cockers you see in the field have a shorter coat than those in the show ring. They are 14 to 17 inches tall at the shoulder and weigh between 26 and 34 pounds.As sporting dogs, English Cockers have a lot of stamina and energy. They're also curious dogs and like to investigate things. English Cocker Spaniels are excellent retrievers with delicate mouths who hunt well in difficult terrain.While English Cockers are intelligent, they can be stubborn at times, especially if they don't see a good reason for doing what you want them to do. Obedience training is a good idea with any dog, but with hunting dogs in particular, you need to train them to come when called and to obey your commands.Because they are so affectionate toward their people, it's important to use gentle, consistent training that won't break your dog's spirit. Training also helps keep your English Cocker mentally stimulated. This is a dog that loves to learn. An English Cocker's talents aren't limited to the field. He can also do well in tracking, obedience trials, flyball, and agility.Because English Cockers are very people-oriented, they thrive on being around their families and can become destructive if left alone frequently with no companionship or activity. They get along well with children and make good companions for people of all ages.While they are alert and will bark at noises, don't expect them to be effective guard dogs. They are far too friendly for that kind of work and most likely will end up licking the hands of any strangers they encounter, all the while wagging their tails."

A description of Belvoir Gambler, recognized as the greatest English Foxhound ever bred, says, ""Next to an old Greek statue, there are few such combinations of grace and strength as a fine Foxhound.""This rare breed has never made the leap to popular companion dog, but he is certainly a dog to consider if you're a jogger or runner or would like a canine friend to accompany you on horseback rides. This intelligent, courageous hound can cover long distances without a break. Foxhunters prize him for his stamina, good nose, and determination.Those characteristics have pros and cons for people who are interested in him as a companion. For example, his stamina and determination make him a good pal for marathon runners, but his powerful scenting ability can make him desirous of following an interesting trail rather than going where you want.He needs daily exercise, so he's not a good choice for the weekend warrior. And being a hound, whose job it is to go after prey, he must be kept on leash in areas where he could run in front of a car. On the up side, he's gentle, social, and tolerant, making him a good family dog for people with an active lifestyle who have plenty of time to devote to keeping him busy.Because of his high energy level, he's not really suited to apartment life. He needs a daily exercise partner and a large fenced yard or, better yet, an acreage where he can run.English Foxhounds are working dogs. If you are looking for an English Foxhound as simply a companion, seek out one that has been bred for the show ring rather than for hunting. He'll have a little less energy and drive than a field dog."
Mark Cook,Dog,English Setter,https://cdn2-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2011/01/file_22968_english-setter-460x290.jpg,Female,7,Available,"Known as ""the moderate setter,"" the graceful English Setter's love of people and easygoing nature can make him a super friend for an active family as well as a fine hunting dog. He's not as rollicking as the Irish setter nor as standoffish toward strangers as the Gordon Setter. Gentle, kind, and affectionate, he's devoted to his family, sociable with strangers, and gets along just fine with kids.While he isn't precise enough to achieve the highest scores in obedience competition, he is moderately easy to train. The English Setter is a good watchdog and will bark to alert his people that someone is approaching the house. Once he's introduced to guests, however, he happily accepts their presence. All these qualities make him a good choice for a first-time dog owner who appreciates this breed's beauty and sweetness and can provide him with the exercise he needs.English Setters are quiet indoors, but outside they love to run and play with other dogs and people. A daily run, off-leash play in a fenced area, or an energetic hike through a nearby park or wilderness area will be just this English breed's cup of tea.While he's generally mild mannered and sensitive, the English Setter can be a little willful. Counter that tendency with kind but firm training from early puppyhood, and set boundaries so he knows exactly what you expect.Avoid harsh training techniques. A spoonful of sugar _яс in the form of praise or a treat when he does what you like _яс will work much better than an angry voice. His tendency toward independent decision making _яс he's been bred for centuries to work at a distance from the hunter _яс means you must find interesting ways to hold his attention and teach him what you want him to know.Because they're so athletic, English Setters excel at activities such as agility and rally obedience. They can also make super therapy dogs with their easygoing disposition and love of people. Birders may like him, too. When he sees birds, he stands still and leans forward intently, sets, or points, one paw raised in the air.Of course, hunting comes naturally to most English Setters, and they make an excellent choice for the hobby hunter or for someone who may want to compete in hunt tests or field trials. If you are interested in hunting with your English Setter, look for a breeder who breeds his dogs for their hunting skills and has proven hunting instincts in his lines, which will assure that you have better success.Conformation showing (competing in dog shows) is another activity you can pursue with your English Setter; again, make sure you work with a breeder to obtain a puppy who can succeed in the breed ring.Like many sporting dogs, the English Setter is divided into two types. Those bred for the field have less feathering _яс long fringes of hair, usually on the legs, belly, and tail _яс and their coat is not as abundant. They are somewhat smaller than English Setters bred for the show ring. You may hear them called Llewellin or Llewellin-type English Setters after the British gentleman who most influenced their development. They are said to have more instinct for hunting than the show lines of English Setters, known as Laverack or Laverack-type English Setters. Edward Laverack was the first recorded breeder of English Setters. His dogs Ponto and Old Moll, acquired in 1825, were the foundation of the breed.If you want a beautiful, mellow dog with the potential to become your partner in all sorts of activities as well as a beloved family member, the English Setter is one to consider. His lovable disposition and lively spirit will inspire your devotion."

They are happy dogs and seem to have a good sense of humor. They usually do well with children if they are brought up with them from puppyhood and are affectionate toward their families. They also are generally good with other pets in the household, even small ones, but might see pet birds as prey since those are what they're bred to hunt.Because they're hunting dogs, English Springer Spaniels require a lot of exercise, but keep them on leash in unfenced areas or they may decide to go hunting on their own. Because they are such good athletes, many non-hunting owners participate in activities such as obedience, agility, flyball, and tracking with their English Springer Spaniels. They also make great therapy dogs, bringing smiles to people in hospitals and nursing homes.English Springer Spaniels will bark if strangers come to your house, but if you're looking for a guard dog, keep looking. They are loving, gentle dogs who expect even strangers to give them attention.Because of their affectionate nature, they aren't a one-person dog. They are very people-oriented, and shouldn't be left home alone or isolated from people for long periods.English Springers are medium-size dogs with the typical gentle spaniel expression and drop ears. Their compact body is protected by a dense, medium-length coat adorned with feathering, a longer fringe of hair, on the ears, chest, legs, and belly. The wag of the docked tail can only be described as merry. Their bodies are a little longer than they are tall. That's because a dog can tire easily when his body is too longК__ясК_highly undesirable for a hardworking sporting dog!Those are the basics, but if you were to put two English Springer Spaniels next to each other, they might look very different. That's because in many sporting (hunting) breeds, some dogs are bred to work in the field, while others are bred primarily to be show dogs. Eventually, they become two very different types, and that's what has happened with English Springer Spaniels. Why are we telling you this? Read on and we'll explain.The gene pools of field and show dogs have been almost completely segregated for about 70 years. Field Springer Spaniels are athletes and they look the part. They usually have shorter coats, their noses are pointier, and their ears are not as long. Field Springers are bred for hunting ability, sense of smell, and trainability.Show Spring Spaniels have longer hair, a squarer muzzle, and longer ears. They're prized for their good looks and showmanship. (A prime example of this type is JamesК__ясК_more formally known as Ch. Felicity's Diamond JimК__ясК_who won Best in Show at Westminster in 2007.) Show dogs can hunt, but they're too slow and methodical to do well in field trials, which is where field-bred Springers shine.The differences affect you when you're choosing a puppy. Both types need lots of exercise, but if you want a companion, a field-bred Springer may have more energy than you need or want. Look for a puppy from show lines. If you want a Springer who will be competitive in field trials, just the opposite is true.It's essential, then, to have a clear idea of what you want from a Springer when you talk to breeders. They can help you choose the puppy that's right for you or direct you to a breeder whose dogs will better fit your needs. In fact, that's the test of a really great breeder--she wants to help you find the dog that's right for you, even if that means losing a sale."

He has been loved by kings and held in high regard by many.Charlies are compact, square-bodied dogs with a short face, domed head, large dark eyes, long fringed ears, and a flowing silky coat. Their docked tail is two to four inches long and is adorned with silky feathering. He wears a straight or slightly wavy coat with feathering on the legs and feet.The English Toy Spaniel is a quiet, unassuming breed that was developed as a companion dog. He requires little exercise and has a laidback personality. The ET's idea of a great day is to spend it sitting near his favorite person, quietly showering her with love. Charlies make excellent companions for seniors or anyone who doesn't have the strength or mobility to handle other dogs. That devotion to people can be a negative trait, however, because he can suffer from separation anxiety.English Toy Spaniels do well in apartments and can adapt to any lifestyle except being left alone for long periods of time or left to live outside or in kennels. They generally get along well with other dogs but can be shy and timid in the presence of strangers. English Toy Spaniels are very gentle with children but are not recommended for homes with young children since the accompanying noise and excitement may overwhelm them.For fun, he likes to chase birds and butterflies. Keep him on leash outdoors so he doesn't chase them right in front of a car.Training can be easy with this breed as long as you understand his nature. He's independent and will occasionally disregard commands when they are first given. Generally, however, he's happy to please and enjoys the companionship training provides. English Toy Spaniels may bark to alert you to someone's approach and they might bite someone who scares them or whom they don't like, but that's about the extent of their watchdog ability.An English Toy Spaniel should be monitored in hot weather because his short muzzle makes him susceptible to heat exhaustion. He should live in a home with adequate ventilation and air conditioning, and his time outdoors should be limited during hot and humid weather.If you are looking for a dignified dog who is calm, affectionate, and gentle, one who will enjoy spending all his time with you, one who is happy and devoted, then the English Toy Spaniel is the perfect breed for you."

Jodi Torres,Dog,Field Spaniel,https://cdn3-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2011/01/file_22972_field-spaniel-460x290.jpg,Male,6,Available,"If you and your active family are looking for a medium-sized dog with energy to spare, consider the Field Spaniel. He is larger than the English Cocker Spaniel and smaller than the English Springer Spaniel.He's a wonderful companion for family that can meet his needs for exercise, training, and companionship, and he will give you years of competition in such dog sports as obedience, agility, rally, tracking, hunt tests and conformation. Hunters will appreciate their ability to quarter in dense coverК__ясК_that means he hunts by running a zigzag pattern through heavy brushК__ясК_and flush birds such as pheasants, quail, and chukars.Field Spaniels love people, and they are eager to please, loyal, and loving. At playtime, their water-loving nature comes out. They will sometimes use their water dish as the local swimming hole, making quite a mess around the house.While they can sometimes be reserved with strangers, they should never be fearful, shy, or aggressive. Some Field Spaniels bond with just one family member, but most accept everyone in the family as their best friends. They are excellent with children but aren't fond of rough, loud play, preferring to walk away and find a quieter activity. Field Spaniels are alert and will bark a warning when visitors approach, but they are not guard dogs.Training, whether it's for dog sports or nice household manners, helps prevent your Field Spaniel from becoming bored and getting into mischief. It's important to work around the independent streak that allows this breed to perform so well in the field. If you use motivational methods and frequent rewards, you will end up with a happy dog who is a joy to work with. Field Spaniels are extremely sensitive dogs and do not respond well to loud tones of voice or harsh handling.Field Spaniels require less grooming than most other spaniel breeds. Even to get them ready for the conformation show ring is not an involved process as they are to be shown looking as natural as possible. No fancy trimming necessary!The Field Spaniel is a rare breed that can be hard to find. Take the time to research breeders and find one who is willing to help you find just the right puppy. A responsible breeder will ensure that your puppy's parents are screened for any genetic conditions that may exist in the breed and will be diligent in removing from the gene pool any dogs with serious health conditions for which no screening test is yet available."

These days, he still has a strong herding instinct that can be put to use with more common varieties of livestock. He can also enjoy other dog jobs such as agility, obedience, and therapy work.Friendly toward people and gentle with children, he's a good companion for people who don't mind a dog with a long, profuse coat."
Vanessa Drake,Dog,Finnish Spitz,https://cdn1-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2011/01/file_23148_finnish-spitz-460x290.jpg,Male,8,Available,"The Finnish Spitz has the distinction of being the national dog of Finland, where this ancient hunting breed is still used to hunt a wide variety of game.In Finland, he's known as the Suomenpystykorva (pronounced SWOH-men-pi-stih-KOR-vuh), which means Finnish Pricked Ear Dog, and he can't compete there for a show title until he has proved himself in hunting trials. He's also been called the Finnish Barking Bird Dog because of his unique hunting habits, and in England, he's known as Finsk spets.In 1891, the name was officially changed to Finnish Spitz, and the nickname Finkie became popular after the dog's arrival in England in the 1920s.Finnish Spitz dogs have a square build and a fox-like look. They are ""bark pointers,"" meaning they indicate where the game is by barking to attract the hunter's attention. They've mostly been used to hunt small game, such as squirrels and grouse, but they've also hunted moose, elk, and even bear.These are rather small hunting dogs, being about 17 1/2 to 20 inches tall at the shoulder. Their necks are shorter than some of the other Spitz breeds because Finnish Spitz look up to point their game. The head is wedge-shaped and resembles that of a fox.Finnish Spitz have a lively, light gait, and are as intelligent as they are animated. They make good companions for active families. Friendly, they get along well with children. They're good watchdogs and protect their families, but they rarely show aggression unless it's warranted.In America, Finnish Spitz are primarily companion dogs. In their native Finland, however, they're still used for hunting, mostly for a large game bird called a capercaille and for black grouse.The way Finnish Spitz hunt is unique. He runs ahead of the hunter until he finds a bird. Then he follows the bird until it settles in a tree, and attracts the bird's attention by running back and forth under the tree, wagging his tail. It's thought that the bird is lulled into a sense of security by the dog's movements, at which point the Finnish Spitz begins to bark, softly at first and gradually getting louder.The bird generally doesn't notice the hunter approaching because of the noise and action of the dog. If the bird flies off before the hunter reaches it, the Finnish Spitz stops barking and follows it until it lands, then starts barking again. This is the reason these dogs are called ""Bark Pointers.""Elkhound and similar Spitz breeds hunt in a similar fashion. In Scandinavia, barking competitions are held for the King of the Barkers. Finnish Spitz have been recorded as barking 160 times per minute in competitions.By now, you've probably guessed that barking is an important part of the Finnish Spitz makeup. They like to bark. If yours is primarily a companion and you have close neighbors, you'll need to train your dog to stop barking on command, or hope that your neighbors are very tolerant.Training these independent, strong-willed dogs can be a challenge. They are best trained with a soft voice and touch. Their intelligence makes them become easily bored with repetitive training, so keep your training sessions short. Professional trainers say that Finnish Spitz can be manipulative and too smart for their owners, so you need to be persistent and firm. If you stick with it, however, you'll be greatly rewarded by your dog's intelligence and aptitude for sports such as obedience, agility, and rally.Also, keep in mind that Finnish Spitz are slow to mature. It generally takes about four years for them to become mentally mature. In the years building up to that, your Finnish Spitz will need time to decide whether or not he's going to accept you as the leader of the pack. At times, he'll be silly and rebellious; other times he'll be self-contained and contemplative. A Finnish Spitz doesn't tolerate being bullied, but with consistency, fairness, and patience, you'll gain his respect and obedience.Finnish Spitz want to be members of the family and are naturally protective. They are sensitive dogs and don't do well in homes where there's a lot of tension. But give them a loving atmosphere and include them in everything you do and they'll become a loyal, lively, and fun-loving friend."
Stephanie Diaz,Dog,Flat-Coated Retriever,https://cdn2-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2011/01/file_22974_flat-coated-retriever-460x290.jpg,Male,4,Available,"At first glance, you might think the Flat-Coated Retriever resembles a black or brown Golden Retriever, but no such thing. He's a distinctive breed, originally developed as a dual-purpose retriever of game on land and from water. His early popularity, which peaked before World War I, was eclipsed by that of the Golden and Labrador Retrievers, but his fans think that's for the best, preferring to keep the secret of his fun-loving yet hard-working nature to themselves.Flat-Coats are often called the ""Peter Pan"" of retrievers. They generally mature more slowly than other dogs and maintain their puppylike exuberance for years. This playful energy makes them a wonderful and entertaining companion, but it also means extra time and patience when training them. While they are eager to please, Flat-Coats are hams, and they won't hesitate to go for a laugh, even if it means ignoring or disobeying you. In general, however, he's a responsive and sensitive student. A harsh correction will cause him to shut down until you make amends.Tolerant and friendly, Flat-Coats love everyone, including children and other dogs. They'll bark to let you know that someone's approaching, but don't count on them to serve as any kind of guard dog. They are great friends for active older children but may be too energetic for toddlers, knocking them down with a swish of their frequently wagging tail.Although the Flat-Coated Retriever is fairly calm indoors, he's not suited to apartment life. He retains his hunting skills and should live in an environment where his talents can be used--or at least one that gives him the opportunity to run and swim. Expect to give him a couple of 45-minute walks, runs, or other activity daily to satisfy his exercise needs. If you're doing a good job, he'll look well conditioned and lean. Afterward, he'll enjoy relaxing with you in your home. He prefers to be with his people whenever possible.Many breeders and enthusiasts are the first to admit that Flat-Coated Retrievers are not for everyone, but there are a lucky few for whom this affectionate and good-looking retriever is a perfect match."
Robin Leon,Dog,Fox Terrier,https://cdn2-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2011/01/file_23094_fox-terrier-460x290.jpg,Male,9,Available,"Fox Terriers are canine classics who've changed little since their emergence in the late 18th century. There are two types: Smooth Fox Terriers are sleek, elegant, and intelligent, while Wire Fox Terriers are handsome, happy, and quite stylish when groomed properly. Called Fox Terriers or Foxys for short, both are outgoing, active, and inquisitive, with a devil-may-care attitude. They live in the moment, enjoying whatever's going on.Smooth Fox Terriers are not very common these days outside of hunting and show circles, but they're important because many other terrier breeds are believed to have descended from them. The Smooth Fox Terrier also holds the distinction of being the first breed in the fox terrier group to be officially recognized by England's Kennel Club in 1875.Historically, Fox Terriers were used to ""bolt"" foxes when they ran into their hiding places and drive them toward the foxhounds and hunters. White Smooth Fox Terriers were highly prized because they were less likely to be mistaken for the fox. Wires were favored for hunting in rough country, their coats making them less vulnerable to injury than their smooth-coated counterparts. Although Fox Terriers seldom are used for hunting now, they still have a strong prey drive and will dig with reckless abandon after underground vermin.Hardy and healthy, Fox Terriers generally live well into their teens. Their handy 15- to 20-pound size makes them small enough to take just about anywhere but big enough for rough and tumble play. Their fiery disposition is evident in their small, dark eyes.These are bold and energetic dogs that love to play with children. They're loyal to their families but impulsively scrappy with other dogs, never hesitating to pick fights, even with much bigger dogs. Unless they've been trained and socialized to get along with other family pets, they shouldn't be trusted alone with them.Fox Terriers have a lot of self-confidence and love to explore. Never turn your Fox Terrier out in an unsecured area without a leash, and periodically check your fence to make sure he hasn't been digging an escape route.Because they're so intelligent, Fox Terriers are naturals for obedience, agility, and earth trials. They also can learn tricks easily. Like most terriers, they're willful and need firm (not harsh), consistent training methods. Because of their smarts and stamina, they need plenty of mental and physical stimulation to keep them from resorting to destructive behaviors such as excessive barking, chewing, digging, and chasing other animals. Exercise, exercise, and more exercise is the key. A tired Fox Terrier is a good Fox Terrier. Unfortunately, you'll probably be tired before he is.Fox Terriers make excellent watchdogs. So long as their barking isn't triggered by being left alone for too long in the yard by themselves, you should take comfort in knowing that your Fox Terrier will sound an alarm if he hears or sees something amiss in his territory. Your Fox Terrier will always be on the job of guarding your home and family.With their outgoing, self-assured personalities, Fox Terriers can get into lots of mischief, including raiding the kitchen table and breaking out of the yard. They love toys and balls, and many adore playing in the water. While Fox Terrier puppies are difficult to resist, be aware that when grown, they'll need a lot of attention and stimulation to keep them out of trouble. If you can stay a step or two ahead of them, though, they're lively and long-lived companions."
Vickie Jacobs,Dog,French Bulldog,https://cdn1-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2011/01/file_23150_french-bulldog-460x290.jpg,Female,4,Available,"Bat-eared but oddly beautiful, the French Bulldog has a unique appeal. Aesthetically, other breeds undeniably are more glamorous and showy, but beauty is in the eye of the beholder and what many behold in the French Bulldog are the attributes that make this breed one of the best companion dogs in the world today.The French Bulldog is small but substantial in build with a powerful muscular body. He sports a short easy-care coat to accompany his easygoing personality. The Frenchie likes to play, but he also enjoys spending his days relaxing on the sofa.That love of play and relaxed attitude carry over into their training sessions. French Bulldogs are intelligent, and training them is easy as long as you make it seem like a game and keep it fun. They are free thinkers and are not an ideal breed for competing in obedience or agility although some have risen to the challenge. This freethinking approach can also lead to a stubborn nature, and if they decide to dig in their heels there is no budging them.Frenchies are loving companions who thrive on human contact. If you want an outdoor dog who can be left alone for long periods, the Frenchie is not the breed for you. This is a dog who enjoys lavishing love on his human companions as much as he loves the same treatment in return. They generally get along well with everyone, including children. They can, however, be territorial and possessive of their people, especially in the presence of other dogs. Socialization is a must for this breed, but with their easy companionship this is an enjoyable task.With a nature that is both humorous and mischievous, the French Bulldog needs to live with someone who is consistent, firm, and patient with all the antics and idiosyncrasies that make him both frustrating and delightful.French Bulldogs make excellent watchdogs and will alert their people to approaching strangers, but it's not their style to bark without cause. They can be protective of their home and family and some will try to defend both with their life.French Bulldogs do not need a lot of room and do very well in apartments or small dwellings. A couple of 15-minute walks per day should keep them from becoming overweight. Keep the Frenchie in cool, comfortable surroundings. He's susceptible to heat exhaustion and needs an air-conditioned environment. This is not a dog who can stay outside on a hot day.French Bulldogs are wonderful companion dogs with a gentle nature. If you work at home, the Frenchie is happy to lie at your feet all day or follow you from room to room. People who love them describe them as mischievous goof balls and can't imagine life without them. They are a constant presence, and they'll love you with all the strength in their small bodies, proving time and again that beauty is on the inside."

He loves being with his family and will meld himself into every facet of your life.The German Pinscher's playfulness will continue well into adulthood, and he may continue to disembowel squeaky toys long past teething (dental floss is the best repair tool). When German Pinchers are in a spot of trouble at home, some will look you right in the eye and smile, showing their teeth in a big grin.The German Pinscher was originally developed as a working dog who hunted and killed vermin (that means he'll still nail them today, so he's not going to be good in a home with pet rodents). Today, he still has the energy of a working breed and has proved himself to be an all-around kind of guy when it comes to canine sports and careers. You can find German Pinschers in the conformation ring, at obedience rallies or agility trials, and at work in tracking. He also works as a service dog, therapy dog, and as a pampered pet who enjoys the comforts of family life.He can be assertive and overbearing, and he'll take over your heart and home in a matter of seconds. Don't kid yourself: he needs a firm, experienced owner who is consistent in training and good at establishing rules right from the beginning. If you tend to wimp out or you want a placid dog, find another breedК__ясК_this one will walk all over you.However, he will also be completely, utterly, and permanently devoted to you. This devotion supports his ability to be an excellent guard dog. Despite an independent streak, he likes to be in the middle of all family activities, right there with you.The German Pinscher will alert bark with a strong voice. If any intruder risks entering your home, this dog will defend it with everything he's got. And he's quite capable of taking care of an intruder: While he's not the largest guard dog around, maxing out at about 45 pounds, he's incredibly skillful at the job.Given that he looks like a small Doberman Pinscher or a humongous Miniature Pinscher (he was a foundation dog for both of those breeds), and that he's suspicious of strangers, he can make some people nervous. He will accept your friends without problems; it's the folks you don't know who might hear that strong voice he's famous for, the one that sounds like it's coming from a much bigger dog. He saves that voice for special occasions.A German Pinscher is intelligent and quick to learn, and he can reach all levels of training and competition. He also has a personality that will test limits (both his own and yours). Apartments make adequate homes if you properly exercise your German Pinscher, but it isn't his ideal situation. He does better with a yard to run in--a properly fenced yard, to prevent any escape-artist tendencies. He has a strong prey drive and will chase any animal deemed interesting (unfortunately, you are not the one doing the deeming).He must be trainedК__ясК_start him at a young age. Since he's so intelligent, the task isn't difficult, even though he isn't as eager to please you as are some breeds; he really needs a firm and consistent owner. Use positive reinforcement and establish consistent rules, because German Pinschers are known for their strong temperamentК__ясК_given half a chance, he'll take control of the house.But if you take the time and effort, the end result of training the German Pinscher is worth all the time it takes. For one thing, you don't want to end up living with a strong, wary, protective dog who's out of control; for another, it's highly satisfying to train such a smart and capable canine.Socialization is just as important as obedience training for the German Pinscher, and it helps avoid aggressiveness. As a puppy he should be socialized to other dogs, puppies, adults, and children. Most obedience schools offer socialization classes, and he can also run errands with you, take long walks, go to the dog park, and have playdates with canine friends and two-legged children.Although a German Pinscher is a loving family companion, he's not recommended for homes with children under the age of nine because of his strong and assertive nature. This can be overpowering even to some adults, but especially to a child.However, if he's the dog for you, then there's no denying that the happy, loving, intelligent German Pinscher will make your family, life, and home complete."

At the end of the war, Duncan brought the puppy back to his hometown of Los Angeles, trained him, and turned him into one of the most famous dogs in show biz--Rin Tin Tin. Rin Tin Tin went on to appear in dozens of movies and, at the height of his stardom, got 10,000 fan letters a week.The German Shepherd has held many jobs other than movie star--leading the blind, chasing down criminals, sniffing out illegal substances, serving in the military, visiting the sick, and herding stock are just some of the jobs held by this versatile breed.The dog has even taken on the role of national hero. German Shepherds were the search and rescue dogs crawling through the ruins of the World Trade Center after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, looking for survivors and comforting rescue workers and families.The German Shepherd may embody some of the best traits of dogs, but they're not for everyone. Originally bred to herd flocks all day, this is a high-energy dog who needs a lot of activity and exercise. Without it, they're likely to express their boredom and frustration in ways you don't like, such as barking and chewing.The breed also has an aloof and sometimes suspicious nature_ясgreat for a watchdog, but not the sort of family dog who'll make guests feel welcome. However, if you expose a German Shepherd to many different situations and people starting in puppyhood, they can learn to take new people and circumstances in stride.If you're adopting a puppy, you'll get a slightly different kind of German Shepherd depending on whether they're descended from dogs that come from American versus German breeders. In general, American breeders often aim to create dog show champions, and they breed more for that distinctive German Shepherd look than for distinctive German Shepherd talents.Fans say that American-bred German Shepherds are calmer than their German counterparts, but critics say these dogs have lost some of their talents for working traditional German Shepherd jobs, and are more prone to behavior problems such as separation anxiety.German breeders, on the other hand, breed for working abilities, as well as to fit the breed's traditional look. Before a German Shepherd is bred in Germany, they have to pass numerous tests to prove they measure up to the physical and mental benchmarks the breed is known for. German Shepherd Dogs from Germany tend to have a more energetic and driven personality.However, the only way to guarantee what kind of dog you're going to get is to spend time with them.

He hunts feathered and furred game and will even trail deer. In the evening, he plays with the kids or curls up next to you on the sofa. Not a hunter? The German Shorthair will be happy to hike or jog with you.Slightly smaller than a Pointer, the GSP has an elegantly chiseled head with dark almond-shaped eyes, an intelligent, good-humored expression, and a large, dark nose. Broad, dropped ears are set high and lie flat against the head. But the most striking aspect of the GSP's appearance is his short, dense, sleek coat of solid liver or liver and white, which can be patched, ticked or roan. The tail is usually docked, leaving about 40 percent of the original length.This energetic, intelligent dog is enthusiastic at work and play. He likes being with people and is a good friend to children, albeit a bit rambunctious for little ones. That people-loving personality causes the GSP to be unhappy if left alone for long periods, and he can become nervous and destructive if he's not provided with regular companionship and exercise. He'll bark at strangers but isn't aggressive. Males tend to be more outgoing and are more aggressive hunters than females.The muscular GSP needs a great deal of exercise. Expect to give him a workout of an hour or two daily. With his webbed feet and water-resistant coat, he's a great water dog and loves to swim. If you have a pool, expect him to be in it with you.GSPs like to please their people and will work hard for them, especially if they're rewarded with praise, play, or food. They typically aren't stubborn and learn new exercises quickly. The biggest challenge is to keep them focused on training. They can get bored easily.This is one of the few hunting breeds that can perform virtually all gundog roles. The GSP can be a pointer and a retriever.

The German Wirehaired Pointer loves having a job to do and thrives on attention.Training him to compete in obedience, tracking, agility, rally, or other dog sports gives him a job, mental stimulation, and exercise. The breed can be slightly independent so it's important to use a firm, consistent approach and not to back down when he challenges your authority. That said, he doesn't respond to harsh training methods but does best with motivational, reward-based training.Search and rescue dog handlers have recently discovered this breed and find them to be excellent workers. That's not surprising since search and rescue combines their love of people and desire for plenty of physical exercise and mental stimulation.The German Wirehaired Pointer is a versatile dog who excels in the show ring, many physical competitions, and more. He can be your jogging friend early in the morning and sit around the campfire with you at night. If you like a dog who is intelligent, independent, eager to learn, and willing to please with tons of energy to burn, then you may have found the perfect addition to your household."

He has a commanding appearance and rugged build. But his stoic demeanor is belied by the twinkle in his eyes, hinting at his playful nature.This is a big dog with a big personality. He's an energetic, intelligent companion who makes life interesting with his independent thinking and playfulness, but dominant personality and bold approach to life. In short, he's a handful, even for experienced dog owners. Still, in the right home he's a loyal and courageous companion.There is no limit to the capabilities of a well-trained Giant Schnauzer. Obedience, agility, tracking, carting, and herding are among the dog sports in which you can find him competing. Originally used to drive cattle to market, he excels as a police and guard dog and more recently has branched out to drug detection and search and rescue. He has a gentle and loving side as well, making him an admirable therapy dog. But the Giant Schnauzer's favorite activity is being with the people he loves.The keys to living successfully with a Giant Schnauzer include training, socialization, and providing physical and mental stimulation. Giant Schnauzers need all of these to become well-mannered dogs, and they need them in abundance.The breed's intelligence is widely known, and they can be easily trained when their people are firm and consistent. Never let the Giant Schnauzer's wonderful mind go to waste. Make sure to give him a job; let him find things for you, carry things, perform tricks, and show off his obedience training.Whatever you do, don't let him become bored. A bored Giant Schnauzer is a destructive Giant Schnauzer. An essential part of preventing boredom is exercise. Expect to provide your Giant Schnauzer with at least an hour of vigorous exercise daily. He'll enjoy long walks and jogging.Apartments are not the ideal dwelling for the Giant Schnauzer. They do much better if they have a large yard to play in and do their best if they have acreage. They are not outdoor dogs and need to live inside with their family.Giant Schnauzers are among the more dominant breeds and not recommended for homes with young children. In fact, the suggested age range of children is 12 and older.Socialization should begin at a very young age, and it should include exposure to many different people, dogs, and other small pets. Giant Schnauzers tend to be reserved and suspicious of strangers, a trait that makes them excellent guard dogs, but that characteristic must be balanced with socialization to avoid fearfulness or aggression.The Giant Schnauzer has many good qualities and many challenging qualities. It's important before choosing this breed that you understand the demands he will make upon your life. A Giant Schnauzer is not the fabled gentle giant, but a hard-working, energetic dog who will give back as much as he is given."
Jessica Dawson,Dog,Glen of Imaal Terrier,https://cdn1-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2011/01/file_23066_glen-of-imaal-terrier-460x290.jpg,Female,5,Available,"This powerful terrier was originally bred to be a tenacious hunter of fox, badger, and rodents, even pursuing his prey underground. Although the modern Glen is more likely to spend his days relaxing with his family, he still has a hunter's heart. Nothing is more enjoyable to him than a good chase after a pesky squirrel or the neighbor's catК__ясК_other than, perhaps, a good dig. A Glen will happily dig up your flower garden if you let him.You can put his hunter's smarts to good use with training, so long as you keep it fun for him; otherwise, he's likely to show his independent streak, and wander off in search of something more interesting. And you can channel his energy and athleticism into dog sports such as agility and obedience competitions.If you're not interested in dog sports, you'll need to find another way to help him burn off energy; Glens need daily exercise. And you'll have to lock up the kibble and keep tempting people food out of reach; this dog has a hearty appetite, and can pack on the pounds very quickly if he's allowed to overeat.The courageous Glen will defend his family if needed, and his loud warning bark will alert you whenever someone approaches the house, making him an excellent watchdog. But that same scrappy spirit can sometimes get him into trouble with other canines. He's unlikely to start a fight, but you can be sure he won't back down from one if challenged. Given enough time to interact with other dogs and practice his canine social skills, however, he can learn to get along with them.It's not hard to fall in love with the affectionate nature and intelligence of this breed. But before you rush out to buy or adopt a Glen, consider that he has many traits common to terriers: a love of digging, an independent streak, and a inborn tendency to chase cats and other small animals. Whether these qualities make him your dream dog or last on your list, take them into account when considering a Glen."

Once they've reached physical maturity (between 18 and 24 months), Goldadors make excellent jogging companions.Training the eager-to-please Goldador is relatively easy - they come from a long line of dogs who work closely and willingly with people. This makes them an excellent choice for first-time owners, provided they get the exercise, structure, and positive reinforcement they crave. Goldadors are also a good option for families with children (though they can be a bit rambunctious for toddlers), as they want nothing more than to be part of family activities.The ideal residence for a Goldador is a home with a fenced yard, but with regular exercise and companionship they can live and thrive in apartments and condos.

The Golden is slow to mature and retains the silly, playful personality of a puppy until three to four years of age, which can be both delightful and annoying. Many keep their puppyish traits into old age.Originally bred for the physically demanding job of retrieving ducks and other fowl for hunters, the Golden needs daily exercise: a walk or jog, free time in the yard, a run at the beach or lake (Goldens love water), or a game of fetch. And like other intelligent breeds who were bred to work, they need to have a job to do, such as retrieving the paper, waking up family members, or competing in dog sports. A tired Golden is a well-behaved Golden.As well as giving your Golden Retriever physical and mental exercise, you should also be prepared to include him in your family activities.

Originally bred as a larger alternative to the already popular designer breed known as the Cockapoo, the Goldendoodle has proven to be an excellent family dog.They're also versatile working dogs. Goldendoodles have achieved success as guide dogs, service dogs, therapy dogs, and sniffer dogs (one study tested their success at sniffing out peanuts in foods for owners with nut allergies). Goldendoodles have also done well in agility.The Goldendoodle is an affectionate and gentle dog that has gained popularity since he was first developed in 1990s. He's still a young cross compared to other designer breeds, and many of today's litters are the results of first-generation breedings between Poodles and Golden Retrievers.Goldendoodles are usually highly social and get along well with everyone. They don't do well in any type of guarding or watchdog role and should not be used in that capacity. They can thrive in both city and country settings, but they're not well suited to apartment living, since they do better with the space provided by a fenced yard. Goldendoodles should not live outside or in a kennel, however, since they thrive when they are in contact with the people they love.Goldendoodles can be very easy to train and are a good match for first-time or timid owners. They're not known to have any aggressive traits, but they do need proper socialization to avoid any shyness or fearfulness. Goldendoodles also need daily contact with their owners; they'll suffer from separation anxiety if they're left for too long.The best way to avoid any destructive behavior is to crate them and to provide toys and treats to keep them busy throughout the day. Keeping the radio on when you're out is another great way to keep them happy.Goldendoodles are considered to be non- to light shedders and may be a good match for people with allergies. They do require weekly or biweekly brushing, and many owners opt to have them clipped.Although Goldendoodles are a young designer breed, that hasn't stopped people from understanding their worth.

He's an active, well-muscled dog capable of working but who would also remain a puppy for his entire life if he could. Gordons are known for maturing late and tend to remain young at heart. The breed is intelligent, gentle, and loyal.Gordons need daily exercise and do best in a home with a large fenced yard where they can expend their energy. The Gordon is not a backyard dog by any means, however, and should not live away from his family. He's prone to separation anxiety and can become destructive when left alone for long periods.Gordon Setters need a firm hand when it comes to training but not so firm that their sensitive spirit is damaged. Consistent, firm, fair training using the techniques of positive reinforcement will prevent them from becoming dominant, wilful and stubborn. The mental activity provided by training will help keep them occupied and out of trouble.Some Gordons can be aggressive toward other dogs, but it's not a common trait in the breed, and they should never be vicious. Toward strangers Gordons can be aloof, preferring the attention of their own people. They'll tolerate attention from strangers but don't actively seek it. To avoid any aggression or fear regarding strangers, it's important to socialize your Gordon SetterК__яс expose him to a variety of people, sights, sounds, and situationsК__яс in puppyhood.

The ferociousness necessary to track down such a large, wily animal was eventually bred out of the Great Dane. He's now a gentle soul who generally gets along well with other dogs, animals, and humans.However, his size and his power bark will scare the wits out of a burglar. Anyone who owns one of these dogs eventually understands that while you may be used to his awesome size, others usually need a little time to get there.The Great Dane was developed from Mastiff-type dogs, but he's more refined than other descendents of this ancient breed. A Great Dane is sleek and elegant. He has an athletic, muscular body. His massive headК__яс and massive is the right wordК__яс is long and narrow. He's got a long, graceful neck. His ears can be cropped or left natural. (Cropped ears are common in the U.S., but in other countries, ear-cropping is banned.)His size can present problems. Eyeballing a dog who weighs what you do makes some folks nervous. His tail can knock over a lot of things, particularly in a small space. And given the opportunity, he's an impressive counter surfer. Luckily, he isn't rambunctious or highly energetic.Size notwithstanding, a Great Dane is a sweet, affectionate companion. He loves to play and is gentle with children. He has a peaceful disposition, although he hasn't lost any of the courageousness that helped him hunt wild boar. Although he isn't particularly vocal (despite his killer power bark), he wouldn't hesitate to defend his family.Even given his inherent gentleness, it's advisable to teach him good manners and attend obedience training classes when he's young. His sheer size alone could make him impossible to control when he's an adult, andК__яс as with any dogК__яс you never know when he might see something he just has to chase.He's eager to please and highly people-oriented, demanding a great deal of attention from those around him. He tends to nudge people with that big old head of his when he wants to be petted. Sometimes you'll meet one with lapdog tendencies who see no reason not to hop onto the sofa and drape themselves on you.Surprisingly, the Great Dane typically doesn't eat as much food as you'd think. And while he needs daily exercise, he doesn't need a huge yard to play in (although he certainly would enjoy one).Because of his beauty and gentle nature, more and more people are discovering the Great Dane. He currently ranks as the 24th most popular dog breed, according to registrations with the American Kennel Club.Just be aware that because of his size, he's got a relatively short life span of around eight years old.

If not, he will become completely uncontrollableК__яс and at his full size of up to 160 pounds, you don't want that. Since training takes lots of consistency, patience, and positive reinforcement, the Great Pyrenees is not suitable for an owner who's reluctant to put in the necessary team.He's worth the work, though. Calm inside the house, he somehow manages not to get underfoot, and has an amazing ability to determine friend from foe. A Pyr is courageous and devoted to his family, protecting those he loves with his life if needed.Many folks feel safer with a Great Pyrenees in their home, but it's worth reemphasizing that he's a dog who requires lots of socialization, starting as early as possible. If he doesn't receive it, he can become aggressive or fearful, and he may not allow nonfamily members into your yard without (or even with) your permission. That may sound kind of cool until you stop receiving mail and your friends refuse to come over.When brought up right, he's a social guy, and he likes to be active and to play with other dogs of any breed. He loves children, and it's best to give him as much exposure to them as you can. Once he's trained, you can take him to nursing homes as his size is perfect for those confined to wheelchairs. He loves going for rides in the car, but make sure the air-conditioner is on high. He's a big fan of cool weather.Everyone who lives with a Pyr should have a set of ear plugs. He barks a lot, because that's his job. He'll vocalizeК__яс loudlyК__яс to ward off pesky intruders, and he's got a broad definition of intruders.

His vocal styling will definitely scare them away and keep the family and property safe.A Pyr's hearing is so sensitive he can detect intruders even with all the windows closed in the house; the air-conditioner, TV, and dehumidifier running on high; and the iPod playing AC/DC at full blast. He really can hear that well, and he'll definitely let you know all about what he hears.He'll let you know his emotions, too. Almost all Pyrs use a paw to let their people know how much they are loved.

Never mind that detail; he'll squeeze himself in one way or the other, even if it seems physically impossible. A Great Pyr will remind you that his comfort should be of the utmost importance to you.

The iconic hound with the aerodynamic build epitomizes speed with his narrow head, long legs, and muscular rear end. We've all seen images of this sprinter, if only through seeing it plastered on the side of a bus, but many of us don't truly know the breed.One of the most ancient of breeds, Greyhounds probably originated in Egypt and have been prized throughout history. Historic figures who were captivated by this breed include Cleopatra, Queen Elizabeth I of England, and General Custer, who raced his dogs the day before he set off on his fateful trip to Little Big Horn. The patronage of the two queens led to Greyhound racing being dubbed the ""Sport of Queens.""Aside from its royal fans, there's a lot to love about the breed. The Greyhound combines a stately appearance with a friendly attitude toward people and other dogs. Loyal and affectionate with his family, he's not aggressive toward strangers, although he will let you knowК__яс through a bark or a subtle pricking of his small, folded earsК__яс that someone's approaching your home.Greyhounds have a reputation for high energy levels, but in reality their favorite pastime is sleeping. Designed as sprinters, not distance runners, they'll be satisfied with a daily walk, although active people find they make good jogging or running partners. In fact, Greyhounds do fine in apartments or homes with small yards--although they need a solid fence to keep them from chasing animals they might see as prey, such as squirrels, rabbits, or trespassing cats.Regardless of their strong prey drive, there's no doubt that this is a wonderful breed that deserves many belly rubs. Whether you bought your Greyhound from a show breeder or adopted him from the racetrack, you'll find yourself regarding this breed with the same respect that others have given it throughout its long and glorious history."

These lively, active scent hounds were originally bred to hunt hares and foxes in large packs, but they also are wonderful family companions.Don't expect to find one in your neighborhood, however. They are one of the rarest breeds registered with the American Kennel Club. In 1994, for example, there were only four Harrier litters born in the entire United States (resulting in only 31 puppies).Built to work, Harriers have lots of bone and substance for their size. Their muzzles are long with a well-developed nose and open nostrils. Their eyes are dark, alert, and intelligent. Speed is not as important as stamina for these dogs. Hares and foxes have been known to drop from exhaustion after being pursued by a relentless pack of Harriers.Harriers have long, dropped ears, and their feet have thick pads that enable them to run for hours through rough terrain. They have broad chests to provide lots of room for their hearts and lungs. Their tails are set high and carried upright (not curled over their backs), making it easier for hunters to see them from a distance or in thick brush.Harriers have a playful, outgoing personality. They are not quite as outgoing as the Beagle, but they definitely love to be around people and other animals. They generally are sweet-tempered and tolerant of children.You should watch them, however, around pets that aren't dogs. Because they are pack dogs, they generally get along well with other dogs, but may see cats, hamsters, and other non-canine pets as prey. They like to live in a pack, whether the pack is made up of other dogs or people.You should always keep in mind that your Harrier is an active dog who likes to explore and track. Some like to bay (a loud, prolonged bark). You should have a well-secured fence your dog can't jump over or crawl under, and when you take your Harrier to unsecured areas, such as a park, be sure to keep him on leash. Otherwise, he may take off, chasing a squirrel or a rabbit.Also, remember that Harriers were bred to have a lot of energy and stamina, as well as to think for themselves. They are independent and tireless hunters. These traits, while good for hunting, may present difficulties in training. You'll need to provide them with enough exercise to keep them from becoming bored and destructive.These are dogs who love to be with you, but do not demand attention. They are capable of entertaining themselves. Your job is to make sure that their idea of entertainment doesn't mean getting into mischief!Because they are independent thinkers who can sometimes be stubborn, you should strongly consider obedience training for your Harrier. Because these dogs have great stamina and are energetic without being hyperactive, they do well in performance sports such as agility and rally. They also make great jogging, bicycling, and hiking companions.Although they are relatively inactive in the house, they are not recommended for apartment dwellers unless you are willing to provide them with a great deal of outside exercise every day.Harriers make good watchdogs because they will alert you to any strange noises or visitors to your home. However, don't expect them to be guard dogs. They are so friendly that they often greet strangers as though they were old friends.Although they are sweet, even-tempered dogs, Harriers are not recommended for first-time dog owners because of their training and exercise needs."

Havanese dogs are quite trainable, and they've worked as therapy and assistance dogs, sniffed out mold and termites, and shown off their clownish antics as performing dogs.They've also got a surprising amount of energy for their size, and for the family looking to compete, the Havanese will happily tackle such sports as agility, freestyle, obedience, and flyball.As with many small dogs, it's common for adoring owners to overindulge their Havanese. They'll probably regret itК__яс bad habits, such as eating only people food, can form very quickly. This breed is a sharp con artist, and you may find that your Havanese is training you, rather than the other way around.In spite of his quirks, or maybe even because of them, the Havanese is a wonderful and versatile pet."

Though, they will also howl if they are happy or excited.The Hokkaido breed has a thick coat that should be brushed out once or twice a week to remove dead fur and prevent matting. The frequency of brushing should be increased during their shedding period.Hokkaido dogs do not enjoy taking baths, and it takes a long time for their coat to dry due to its density. Baths are recommended generally a few times a year to prevent issues.Their thick coats make Hokkaidos able to withstand cold weather well.Hokkaidos can do well in apartments as long as their exercise needs are met, but they may prefer a larger home with a yard.Hokkaidos are good with children and love all members of the family."

The beautiful red and white dog has a long, narrow head that resembles that of the Egyptian jackal god Anubis, large, erect ears that can point forward, sideways, or be folded backward, and flesh-colored pigment on the nose and eye rims, all of which combine to give him a unique appearance. More important is the wonderful personality that shines through.The Ibizan Hound, nicknamed Beezer by his fans, is playful and sometimes silly. He's not a touchy-feely dog, but he enjoys snuggling with members of his family. The Ibizan can be reserved with strangers and protective of his home, but he should never be shy or aggressive.A medium-size sighthound who was developed to hunt rabbits and other small game, he was bred for speed, stamina, and determination. Today, those talents make this athletic dog a match for some of the top coursing breeds, as well as an excellent competitor in agility, thanks to his ability to jump high and far.Ibizan Hounds enjoy their comfortsК__яс that sleek, sculpted body needs cushioning, after allК__яс and can become couch potatoes who enjoy spending their days sleeping. Their exercise needs are moderate. They'll enjoy a couple of 20- or 30-minute walks or jogs daily. Whenever possible, give them a chance to run full out in a large, safely fenced area.Their ability to jump high from a standstill makes Ibizans notorious as counter surfers. Never trust them alone with food, no matter how out of the way you think it is. Outdoors, protect them with a secure fence that's at least six feet high. Ibizans cannot be trusted off-leash unless they are in a fenced yard. They have a strong prey drive and will chase anything that moves quickly. For this reason, they're not suited to families who have pets such as rabbits, although they get along fine with other dogs and can learn to live with cats if they're raised with them.The Ibizan Hound comes in two coat types, shorthaired and wirehaired, and both are easy to maintain.Regardless of whether you want to compete or simply want a wonderful companion, this could be the breed for you. An Ibizan will walk or run with you, love you, and always make you laugh."

Thanks to the isolation of Iceland, today's Icelandic Sheepdogs _яс also called the Icelandic Spitz or Icelandic Dog _яс probably look a lot like their ancestors.For centuries the Icelandic Sheepdog was used to protect flocks, especially lambs, from birds of prey, and to this day he retains the habit of watching the sky and barking at birds. He also barks to alert his family to anything and everything that he sees or hears. He's too friendly to be much of a guard dog, but you'll never be surprised by visitors.Affectionate, confident, and playful, the Icelandic Sheepdog gets along well with people and other dogs. Males tend to be more laidback and cuddly than females. Trained with consistency and patience, Icelandics learn quickly and willingly."

They were saved from extinction, however, and now they're considered a separate breed from their Irish Setter cousins.As gundogs, they take their own sweet time in learning their duties, but eventually become loyal and reliable hunters. They display a strong zest for life and make great friends for kids who are big enough to stand up to their rambunctious play. Give them a home with lots of room to run, and be prepared to train them with patience and consistency."

Any self-respecting Irish Setter would dispute that claim. These fun-loving dogs are tremendously likeable, not only for their flame-colored hair, but also for their athleticism, grace, and enthusiasm. When you live with an Irish Setter, you can be assured of having a happy, friendly companion who's always ready to rock and roll.Originally developed as a bird dog, the Irish Setter retains the drive and energy of his forefathers. There's nothing he enjoys more than doing new things and going new places, especially if they involve birds. Although he's not seen as much in the field as some other sporting breeds, his hunting instinct is still strong. Once he's trained on birds, he never needs a refresher course.While the Irish Setter loves everyone, he's not suited to every home. He's brimming with energy and requires a minimum of an hour of exercise daily. A large fenced yard or acreage where he can run is important, as is an active family who will include him in everything they do. He can develop separation anxiety or become destructive if he's left to his own devices.Irish Setters come in two types: show and field dogs. Irish Setter show dogs are heavier and larger than field dogs, with a heavier, thicker coat. Both types meet the breed standard _яс a written description of how a breed should look and act. Regardless of size and coat, the Irish Setter should maintain his natural ability to be a gundog.Beyond their talents in the field, Irish Setters excel at many other activities, including obedience, rally, tracking, and agility competition. With their wonderful temperaments, they make terrific therapy dogs and can be found visiting hospices, retirement homes, and children's hospitals, spreading the gift of their warmth, humor, and love.Irish Setters are known for their intelligence, but they're also mischievous and independent. Training them requires much patience and consistency. This breed is slow to mature, so you'll have a full-grown dog with puppylike enthusiasm and activity levels for several years. Not surprisingly, they're great playmates for active older children, but they can be overwhelming for toddlers, who may find themselves bowled over by this rascally redhead.The Irish Setter has been loved by movie stars, presidents, and ordinary people who admire him for his joyful spirit. He's a wonderful companion who will keep you fit and make you laugh throughout your life."
Christine Richards,Dog,Irish Terrier,https://cdn1-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2011/01/file_23068_irish-terrier-460x290.jpg,Female,10,Available,"The Irish Terrier's motto is ""No fear."" Nicknamed ""Daredevil,"" this medium-size, agile dog has a tight, wiry red coat and a snootful of courage. He's animated and loyal, always on guard, and willing to take on anything that comes his way and threatens his people and home.With that tough terrier attitude, however, comes a need for training and socialization from an early age. Irish Terriers are extremely intelligent and learn easily, but any training must work around their independent, willful spirit. If you can make the dog think that training is his idea, you'll get a happy worker who meets or exceeds any goals you may have set for him. That's balanced by a reckless spirit that can be blind to consequences, so it can be necessary to protect him from his sometimes intemperate desire to guard his loved ones.Irish Terriers are wonderful watchdogs, barking to warn their owners of anything new. Some dogs will become excessive barkers if their behavior isn't controlled from the start. Thanking the dog for the alert and then distracting him with another command or game is a good way to make sure your dog learns to control his barking.Irish Terriers are excellent people dogs when they receive early socialization, and this helps make them wonderful family companions. They're best suited to families where someone is home during the day. They aren't overly active indoors and are happy to relax with their people, but they need exercise in the form of walks and occasional romps in a securely fenced area. The Irish Terrier has excellent hunting skills and a strong desire to seek out and destroy vermin, so a fenced yard and leashed walks are necessary for his safety. He'll chase rapidly moving objects without paying attention to where the chase is leading him.Irish Terriers adore children and are great playmates, especially when raised with them. Make sure very young children are supervised at all times to prevent injury to both the dog and the child.Irish Terriers can learn to get along with cats if they're raised with them from puppyhood, but they may not be trustworthy around smaller pets, especially pets from the rodent family such as mice, rats, hamsters, and gerbils. Their terrier instinct to hunt this type of animal may be too strong to overcome.This breed does not do well with other dogs. Irish Terriers can be aggressive toward dogs of the same sex, and they don't back down from a challenge. They will fight to the point of serious injury to themselves or the other dog. Being fearless, they'll take on dogs much larger than themselves without thought for the consequences. Make sure your dog is on leash and you have control when around other dogs at any time.With his speed, endurance, and grace the Irish Terrier is an excellent competitor who loves the challenge of the agility ring. He can do well in the sports of obedience and rally, and his soft mouth and love of water make him a capable hunting dog who can retrieve game birds on land or from water. Irish Terriers are also excellent show dogs.If you're looking for a versatile, active, spunky dog who will watch over your family for many years, the Irish Terrier could be the breed for you. He's not one of the more well-known breeds, so finding a breeder with puppies can be difficult. Expect to spend some time on a waiting list and to pay a higher price than you might for a more popular breed. The expense is well worth it, though, admirers say. If you find the right dog, the Irish Terrier can be the most wonderful companion your family will ever have."

While back in the deeps of time a Poodle ancestor may be lurking in his family tree, the Irish Water Spaniel is most definitely not a Poodle. Rather, he might be described as what the standard Poodle once was: a versatile hunting, pointing, and retrieving dog. Not surprisingly, given his name, the Irish Water Spaniel is known for his strong swimming skills and excels at retrieving waterfowl as well as upland game such as quail, pheasant, and grouse.Not content with his striking looks and hunting talents, he's an entertainer as well. The IWS is known for his clownish behavior. He often makes a game out of a simple task and always seems to be having a wonderful time.Irish Water Spaniels are highly intelligent, active, willing and energetic. The centuries of breeding that have contributed to their retrieving skills have also instilled in them a desire to please. This makes an Irish Water Spaniel relatively easy to train. That said, he has a mischievous streak that can cause him to be a challenge at times to deal with. The breed can do well in obedience work, but that mischievous, fun-loving personality may surface unexpectedly during competition and wreak havoc with your goals for that day.The Irish Water Spaniel is a relatively quiet dog for the most part. He seems to reserve his barking for times when it's necessary to warn his family. His alert and inquisitive temperament makes him an excellent watchdog. While he's usually devoted to the entire family, he may choose a particular person as his favorite.The Irish Water Spaniel's dense coat does require some commitment to grooming on a regular basis. It must be brushed two to three times a week to prevent mats from forming. The natural oils in his water-repellent coat attract dirt and debris and hold it in the coat. Brushing helps to distribute the oil through the coat and removes any debris.An interesting characteristic is their webbed feet, which come in handy when they're swimming. Irish Water Spaniels love to swim and will plunge into any nearby body of water if given half a chance. And they may not be ready to leave the water when you're ready for them to. If you can provide this breed with opportunities to swim, do so! It's great exercise for this high-energy dog.The Irish Water Spaniel can be the perfect companion for an active family with the time to socialize, train, and exercise him. He'll be a devoted, loving member of the family and will entertain all with his clownish and mischievous attitude toward life. Your Irish Water Spaniel can be a hunting companion, conformation, obedience, agility, or rally competitor or just a friend and loving companion for everyone in the family."
Christopher Church,Dog,Irish Wolfhound,https://cdn3-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2011/01/file_23030_irish-wolfhound-460x290.jpg,Female,9,Available,"When Irish eyes are smiling, you can be sure they belong to an Irish Wolfhound. He has a noble and commanding appearance, but beneath his shaggy eyebrows twinkle eyes with a sweet, gentle expression.This ancient breed originated in Ireland, where he served as both a war dog and hunting dog. He came close to extinction in the 19th century after the great prey animals _яс wolves, deer, and wild boars _яс had largely disappeared in Ireland, but the breed was revived and today is a wonderful companion who draws the admiration of many.The Irish Wolfhound is the tallest of all dog breeds and the largest of the sighthounds _яс dogs that chase moving prey. Despite his distant past as a ferocious war dog, he's a gentle giant who gets along with everyone, including children, other dogs, and sometimes even cats. He loves long walks, which are important in maintaining his huge body, but otherwise he's satisfied to be a couch potato.While they're quiet indoors, Irish Wolfhounds are not recommended for apartment living. Consider whether you'd be able to get one up and down the stairs if he were injured or sick. They do best in a home with a large fenced yard where they can have room to run.The Irish Wolfhound is not the ideal watchdog. He doesn't bark an alarm, and although he has the size to deter many would-be intruders he doesn't have the nature of a guard dog. He's brave but not aggressive.Like any dog, the Irish Wolfhound isn't the breed for everyone. His gigantic size alone is a consideration. He has several health issues that potential owners must be aware of. And he's a short-lived breed who has only a 6- to 8-year life span. If you're looking for a breed that lives many years and is easy to care for, then he's not the breed for you. But if you're looking for a companion who will fill your life with love, admiration, and sloppy kisses, then look no further."

This slender, elegant dog is the smallest of the sighthounds _яс the group of dogs bred to hunt by sight and give chase _яс and closely resembles his much larger Greyhound cousin.Agile and athletic, he has a small, muscular body and an elegant high-stepping gait. The IG, as he's often called, retains his instinct for hunting small game and will chase anything that moves. He can reach top speeds of 25 miles per hour, so if he gets loose he won't be easy to catch. Although he's small, he has lots of energy and appreciates plenty of opportunities to exercise. A fit IG can even make a good jogging partner.The Italian Greyhound has a gentle personality, loving and affectionate with family members, but often reserved or shy with strangers. Despite his mild nature, he has a surprisingly deep, big-dog bark, making him a good watchdog _яс although he's too small to back up his barks and provide any actual protection.This is an intelligent breed who can be easy to train, but you'll need to make it fun for him to overcome his ""what's in it for me?"" attitude. When well trained, he can shine in dog sports such as obedience training, agility, and rally. The athletic, graceful IG seems built for agility, and many love the sport and do it well.What they don't do well is housetraining. Like many small breeds, the IG can be difficult to housetrain, and some dogs are never completely trustworthy in the house.Aside from the occasional cleanup, life with an IG is both restful and zestful. He loves snuggling with his people for a while, then flying around the house and jumping on furniture and tabletops. IGs are catlike in their love of high places, and you'll often find them perched on the backs of chairs, on windowsills, or any other high spot they can reach. Older IGs are more sedate and will cuddle with you on your recliner and just enjoy the day.On sunny days, expect to find your IG sunbathing in the yard, one of his favorite pastimes. He loves warmth and is fussy about getting cold or wet. It's not unusual for IG owners to have a sheltered area in the yard so their dogs can go potty on rainy days without getting their feet wet. At night, he'll burrow beneath the covers on your bed.Your IG will demand attention if he feels he's being ignored. Privacy becomes a distant memory once you own an Italian Greyhound, because he'll follow you everywhere at all times. He's also curious and will investigate anything that catches his interest.The Italian Greyhound is one of those small dogs with a big personality. He's affectionate, possessive, and loving, charming his way into your life. If you can give him the attention, exercise, and training he needs _яс not to mention tons of love _яс then the Italian Greyhound can make an elegant and loveable addition to your household."

We can thank one of those hard-hunting English parsons for the Jack Russell Terrier, developed to hunt fox in the south of England some 200 years ago. Parson John Russell, ""Jack"" to his friends, wanted an efficient hunting dog and decided to design exactly the dog he had in mind.The result was a bold, athletic dog who won hearts with his quickness, intelligence, determination, and intense desire to hunt. The Jack Russell Terrier, also called the Parson Russell Terrier, is a favorite among horse owners, dog sports enthusiasts, animal trainers for film and television, and people who simply appreciate his fearless personality, boundless energy, entertaining antics, and portable size.But beware! The trained Jack Russell that you see on TV or in movies doesn't come that way. Teaching a Jack Russell to become a civilized companion is no easy task. It requires lots of time and patience as well as a strong sense of humor. The JRT is highly trainable, but he has a mind of his own and won't stand for boredom. If you don't keep him entertained, he'll find his own amusements, and you probably won't be happy with the results.If you want a dog who can learn tricks, run an agility or flyball course in seconds flat, play fetch until you drop, and who will make a charming companion when he's not getting into mischief, the Jack Russell may be the dog for you. If you can't deal with a dog who will chew, dig, and bark, rocket through the house multiple times daily, chase cats and other small animals with glee and murderous intent, and will always find the loophole in any command you give, he's definitely not the dog for you, no matter how cute and small he is.If you have the time and patience to devote to him, the Jack Russell has many qualities that make him an ideal family dog. He's devoted to his people and loves being with them. His heritage as a hunting dog makes him an excellent jogging companion once he's full grown. Active older children will find him to be a happy and affectionate playmate, but his rambunctious nature can overwhelm younger kids.On the downside, his fearless nature frequently puts him in harm's way. He has tons of energy and won't be satisfied by a sedate walk around the block. This is a dog who loves to run and jump and fetch. Plan on giving him 30 to 45 minutes daily of vigorous exercise.He's an escape artist who's best suited to a home with a yard and a secure fence that can't be climbed, dug under, or jumped over. An underground electronic fence won't contain a JRT. The Jack's strong prey drive makes him entirely untrustworthy off leash, so you'll need snap on the leash when you're outside of fenced areas. And his instinct to ""go to ground"" _яс to dig for prey _яс means your garden isn't safe from excavation.A Jack Russell can fill your days with laughter and love, but only if you can provide him with the attention, training, supervision, and structure he needs. First-time or timid dog owners would do well to start with a less challenging pooch. Do yourself and the dog a favor by considering carefully whether this is the right breed for you. If it is, you're in for a wild but wonderful ride."

Is that a Japanese Chin on your fireplace mantel? It is! People who live with the Chin often marvel at the breed's ability to leap tall furniture in a single bound. The toy-size Japanese Chin has a catlike nature that includes the desire to be in high places, the ability to climb, and the tendency to wash himself. He has also been seen batting at objects much like a cat would.Feline traits notwithstanding, the Japanese Chin has all of the qualities one looks for in a companion dog. He thrives when he's with his people, and he loves everyone. Japanese Chin do well in apartments and will adapt to any living situation, but their tiny size and love of human companionship mean they're not suited to living outdoors or in a kennel.Japanese Chin have the classic look of an Oriental breed with a large, broad head; large, wide-set eyes; and a flattish face. Small, V-shaped ears hang down, set just below the top of the head. They carry their plumed tail jauntily over their back.They have an abundant coat, but looks are deceiving. The Chin is a wash-and-go breed and needs little more than a weekly brushing to maintain his elegant appearance. With the occasional exception of the ear fringes, the coat rarely mats, and it doesn't require any trimming.Intelligent and well mannered, the Japanese Chin learns quickly, but he has a mind of his own. If training becomes repetitive, he will choose to do something more entertaining. He can be difficult to housetrain, but if you're persistent and consistent he'll get the message.In general, the Japanese Chin is a happy dog who gets along with everyone. He's friendly toward other dogs and cats and is a playful companion for older children. Because of his small size, however, he's not suited to homes with young children, who might accidentally injure him. Chin are loving and devoted to their family, but they have a natural shyness around new people and new situations. It's not unusual for them to be slightly aloof with strangers until they get to know them.The Japanese Chin requires little in the way of exercise and is a great companion to people who can't get around easily. He enjoys a daily walk or play session but won't become destructive if you just lie around eating bonbons and playing with him. Chin enjoy playing, and they move with such grace and agility that they rarely disturb anything when they race through a home.These are sensitive dogs. They pick up on the emotions of the home and their owners and will shape their personality to match. If he lives in a home that is quiet and somber, the Japanese Chin will become quiet and reserved, yet still possess all the wonderful traits of a companion dog. If he lives in an active home, he will generally be lively and outgoing.Fun-loving and charming, the Chin can be addictive. People who love him can't imagine life without him, and many can't imagine life without two or three."
Kevin Martinez,Dog,Japanese Spitz,https://cdn3-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2018/06/japanese-spitz-dog-breed-pictures-header-460x260.jpg,Male,8,Available,"The Japanese Spitz was bred to be a small companion dog that is cute, loyal, friendly, and smart. Even though they aren't specifically bred to be watchdogs, they have a courageous nature and an innate desire to protect their families, as well as a bark that is quite loud for their size. Although they are a relatively new breed, Japanese Spitz dogs are becoming increasingly popular due to their pleasant temperament, their ability to get along with other dogs and children, and their fairly low grooming needs, among other traits. They also tend to be healthy dogs with a longer-than-average life expectancy. Dogs of this breed adapt well to apartment living and have low-to-moderate exercise needs. At least one walk a day should keep them happy and prevent boredom, along with the destructive tendencies that are seen in dogs of almost any breed when they are cooped up too long without physical and mental exercise. Japanese Spitz dogs respond well to training and learn quickly. They'd make a decent choice for first-time dog owners, so long as they are prepared to meet the Japanese Spitz's exercise needs and learn the basics of responsible pet parenting before bringing a pooch home."
